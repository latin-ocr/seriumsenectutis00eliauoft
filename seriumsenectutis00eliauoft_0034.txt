1 8 INTRODUCTION

Bale exaggerateS, as the authorship of the Catalogus testium ueritatis and
Varia . . . poemata was Flacius's alone. But there is no reason to doubt that
Bale's researches for his Catalogus enabled him to contribute texts and
commentaries to Flacius's works. As Schmidt notesl Bale had anticipated
Flacius's collection of goliardic verse in the Catalogus testium ueritatis and
Varia . {9' poemata with his own Rhitmi vetustissimi de corrupto ecclesiae statu
(1546).

That Bale and Flacius met in person is clear from an exchange of letters
between Flacius and Archbishop Parker in 1561, while Bale was still alive.
Writing from Jena in search of material for the revised edition of his
Catalogus testium ueritatis, the edition which contains the excerpts from
Elias's SemMiales, Flacius asks Parker to send him manuscripts illustrating
church history and attacking the papacy. Along the wayl he mentions that

Bale told me that he had many old books which could usefully be
placed in the King's public libraries after his death; the same is true
of other books except that they easily perish when inherited by
ignorant heirs.⁸⁰

Flacius and Bale both moved about on the Continent and could have met
in many places, but the most obvious spot would have been Basell where
they shared the same publisherl Oporinus. Bale lived in the Clarakloster
there from 1556, when his name appears in the matriculation list for the
university, until March 1559.⁸¹ Indeed, he may have made his first
contact with Flacius there, as he claims in the preface to his virulent
Declaration of Edmonde Bonners Articles (London, 1561) that it was “wryt-
ten from Basile in Heluetia, an. 1554,”82 which would have been before
he went to Frankfurt in that year.

1t seems unlikely that Bale discovered the Semidiales and relayed their
contents to Flacius while still in Basell since in that case he would almost
surely have made use of them himself in the second part of his Catulo—
