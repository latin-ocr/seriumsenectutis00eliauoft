Elias of Tluiplow: Serium senectutis is an edition and translation of
Elias of Thriplow's only surviving work. Serium senectutis, or ''Grave
Thoughts in Old Agel' is a prosimetrum, or Menippean satire, cast in the
form of a dialogue between Elias and his friend Philip. Composed as an
assemblage of excerpts from other authors which Elias has embellished
and arranged to suit his argument, this dialogue attempts to marry the
encyclopedism and mannered style of Martianus Capella to the stricter
design and heavenly telos of Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy. Its
contents range from a hymn praising the marriages of pagan gods to
Aristotelian proofs of God's existence; its sources include poets, histori-
ans, and standard medieval authors.

This edition offers a critical text with full apparatus; a translati0n; an
introduction to matters of historical, literary, philological and codicologi-
cal interest; notes on sources and interpretation; an index verborum an
index nominum and a bibliography.

Roget Hillas is Assistant Professor of English at Howard University and
has published on the writings of Elias of Thriplow.
