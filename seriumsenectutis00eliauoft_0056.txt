40 INTRODUCTloN

in the Serium senectutis shows that the various forms of the cursus occur
almost exactly as often as we would expect them to by pure chance.
Putting my tally of the cadences for the first 123 periods in the Serium
senectutis in the form employed by Tore Jansonl¹³⁰ we get the following
results:

Furthermore, Elias's long sentences lael< the tight structure of Ald-
helm's,¹³¹ he does not employ Graecisms among his rariora1¹³² and in
elaborating his periods he tends towards qualification or generalization
rather than the vivid and detailed thematic expansion or stylistic varia-
tion of the earlier tradition.¹³³
