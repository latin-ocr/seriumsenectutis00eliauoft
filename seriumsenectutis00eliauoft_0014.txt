Χ PREFACE

keepers and librarians of the British Library' Lincoln Collegel Oxford. the
Bodleian Library, Cambridge University Library, Alderman Library,
Founders Library and the Library of Congress. Thanks are also due to
Anne-Veronique Gilles of the Institut de Recherche et d'Histoire des
Textes and Dr. Julian G. Plante of the Hill Monastic Manuscript Library
for verifying that the Serium senectutis does not occur in any of the
manuscripts which come into their purview. Michael Pavese and Judith
Sumner, my editors at Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies, have
displayed the ideal combination of patience in allowing me to complete
my work and dispatch in completing their own. And I owe a more than
personal debt of gratitude to MRTS and its general editor Professor
Mario Di Cesare for their commitment to publishing scholarship with
such limited commercial prospects. Publication of this book was aided by
a subvention from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Howard
University.

The dissertation upon which this book is based was read by Professors
Hoyt Duggan, V. A. Kolvel Gordon Braden, and Thomas Noble at the
University of Virginia. I thank them in equal measure for their criticism
and encouragement. The Latin text of the Seri um senectutis presented here
has benefited considerably from close readings by Professors Marvin
Colker and Paul-Gerhard Schmidt and two anonymous readers for the
press. As third reader for the press, Professor A. G. Rigg supplied a set
of extraordinarily detailed and perceptive comments which have im-
proved ‚every aspect of this work. I shall be glad to acknowledge all
remaining errors and omissions as my own! if they provoke others to
study further this difficult but interesting author and his works.
