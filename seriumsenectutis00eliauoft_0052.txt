36 INTRODUCTION

(2.21), nemo nempe natus sub sole (2.353), est triuialiter trita de transmissis

One of the implicit rules of Elias's prose is to avoid vowels in hiatus at
any eost, sometimes including sense, as a number of passages in the
commentary will testify.¹¹⁸ This prohibition extends to the elision of
final -umz Elias never allows the juxtaposition, common elsewhere, of -um
est. Note likewise the omission of estlesse because of a proliferation of
vowels and nasals at word junctures in cui templum circa litus cocodril-
lorum Libies et in monte consecratum (10.231-32). Only in the case of veritate
enunciator (1.126) is there a good likelihood that the author himself
allowed vowel hiatus.

It is not at all surprising, given Elias's probable career as a grammar
master, that he betrays a familiarity with the technical language of
grammatica. The grammatical terms he uses in their technical sense are
antonomasice, figurate, and verbalisl-iter.¹¹⁹ More frequently, he uses gram-
matical terms in broader or transferred senses: anomale, coniunctiuus,
continuatiuus, copulatiuus, defectiuus, finalitas, inclinatiuus, infinitiuus,
optatiue, retransitiue, subiunctiuus, transitiuus, and zinzugia. To these, we
should add the rhetorical terms positio and prediuido.

Elias also betrays a lesser familiarity with legal language, which sorts
well with his extended discussion of marriage law at the center of the
Serium senectutis. Legal terms and phrases include cognicionali ter, condemp-
nabilis, coniunctim disiunctimve, indistincte, and reproducere. But Elias be-
trays the limits of his legal learning by using the grammatical term
transitiuus (¹¹transitive'') with a legal sense (¹¹transferable'') at 6.67. And
while Elias shows a knowledge of the technical vocabularies of logie and
theology when discussing material drawn from those disciplines, he
rarely uses them elsewhere in the work.

Elias is a master of circumlocution ancl the many ways in which one
may say the same thing more than once (interpretatio, expolitio).¹²⁰
Hence the proliferation of adjectives and adverbs in phrases articulated
by the construction ve .. . ve. But at times the result is simple pleonasm:
occisus occumberet (3.405), totam per vniuersitatem (3.541-42), sequitur
subsequenter (4.228), male felices et infausti (793). Furthermore, Elias
tends to repeat himself. He repeats Persius's in udo and the Horatian
omnibus et lippis notum et tonsoribus more than once; he repeats his
beloved adverbs in -iter constantly; he repeats his seasonal allegory of
Vulcan, Juno, and Saturn (1.80-84 and 4.27o-77); he tends to narrate the
