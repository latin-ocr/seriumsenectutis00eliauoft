ELIAs AND THE PETRONJus Remuluus 251

paragraph 63 of the Petronius rediuiuus—“Ludicra qui spernit, qui non nisi seria
querit, l Sero spei seruus sero timoris erit''¹⁰—sorts well with the entry for
sabula in Whethamstede's tabula to the De vita scolarium: “Uaria fabularum ludicra
et interdum commixta seriosa, vide libro quarto per totum.''²¹ The meter at the
beginning of book 7 of the Serium senectutis, which follows and reflects a line of
argument developed by the moral rigorist Philip, rejects ludicra as appropriate
only to youth: “Ludicra ludenti iuueni sua sunt sibi menti, s Seria sola senis sunt
conueniencia cordi.'‘¹² But Philip himself characterizoe the sort of moral fable he
wishes Elias to write as a ludicrum (3.751), and the Serium senectutis as a whole
conforms to the mock serious tone of Menippean satire, at least in its verbal
exuberance and its mockery of paganism and other forms of ignorance.

We might infer from this evolving discussion of ludicra that if all three works
are by the same author, the De vita scolarium and Petronius rediuiuus are earlier
works and the Serium senectutis a later work. There is some other evidence to
support such an inference. 'lhe Petronius rediuiuus and De vita scolarium share a
virulent antifeminism which is little in evidence in the Serium senectutis, which
instead devotes itself to the allegorical and legal defense of pagan hierogamies
and especially the marriage of Philology to Mercury in Martianus Capella.¹³ 'Ihe
Petronius rediuiuus and De vita scolarium also share an emphasis on rural virtue
which is not apparent in the double retelling of the Ovidian story of Battus and
Mercury or elsewhere in the Serium senectutis.¹⁴ On the other hand, the Petronius

cione diucius duratiuum. Vnde Marcellus iun's consultus malum quamuis non animo
puniendum tamen censuit ne res mali fieret in exemplo'' (Bn‘tish Library, MS Arundel 11,
fol. 174¹). The entries s.v. iudex, ius, and lex also contain legal material.

¹² Serium senectutis 73-4. Note the internal rhyme in the hexameter line of both this
couplet and that already cited from the Petronius rediuiuus.

¹³ Pieces 7-9 of the Petronius rediuiuus all turn upon the alleged sexual insatiability and
moral debility of women. Piece 12, a character sketch '‘De feminis,‘' points the moral
bluntly: “Ad tria principaliter suam queuis femina dirigit intencionem: ut caducum curet
corpus et ornet, ut mares circumueniat, ut eis placens maribus uenerie succumbat'' (ed.
Colker, 233). Similar sentiments can be found in Whethamstede‘s tabula, s.v. coniunx, semina,
mechus, and vxor. ln fact, the similarity is close enough that the author‘s remark in para-
graph 73 of the Petronius rediuiuus, “Atqui ut et alias asserere non formidaui, mas omnis
rudissime delirat qui feminas ab errore per custodias . . . a furoribus per rationes auertere
sperat¹' (ed. Colker, 213) may be a reference to the material which Whethamstede summa-
rizoe s.v. semina in this fashion: “De dolis feminarum ac fallaciis, vide libro quarto, prosis
7, 8, and 9 per totum'' (MS Arundel 11, fol. 172⁹). However, the entries under coniunx,
mechus, and uxor make it clear that Elias is concemed ma'inly with the wiles women use to
excuse their illicit relations after the fact. And there is nothing in Whethamstede's tabula to
indicate that the De vita scolarium contained the sort of obscene material, derived from
Petronius, which is sufficient cause for the Petronius rediuiuus to lack any author-ia! attribu—
tion.

¹⁴ Compare piece 14, “De ruricolis,'' in the Petronius rediuiuus with the entry sv. rus in
Whethamstede's tabula to the De vita scolarium. The former contains the author¹s claim that
he himself was born to fanners: ‘'De his [se. ruricolis] profecto, non minus ut reor uerax
quam libens assertor, assero, eoque libentior forte quod a talibus natiuam natus originem
traho, quod inter homines sub sole soli uita uiuant minus uiciis abili'¹ (ed. Colker, 234). 'lhe
latter embellishes the theme of rural virtue with classica! exemplars: ''In rure vel nusquam
sub luna lucet Lucrecie castitas, Semelis simplicitas, illaritas Cereris, sedulitas Penelopes.
