BOOK TWELVE 211

showing healthy good sense and so are willing to run the risk that
everyone will inexorably judge you different from all other men,
subject to eternal ignominy and destined to perpetual punishment
in hell, you should be an eager proponent, constant in your certain
knowledge, of the permanence and immortality of the human soul.
1f you wish to live unharmed here on earth, if moreover you care to
show some healthy good sense, you will also be willing to worship
assiduously only one God and voluntarily profess faith in Him.
Likewise, you should continually commend with zeal the virtual
marriage or intellectual commerce, as permanent as marriage,
between soul and tongue: a union clearly indestructible by time and
to be observed without end. In this way you will profit yourself
and those who live with you and gain the affectionate approbation
of the world at large, knowing your supreme Savior in the certainty
of hope and sensing Him to be propitious in his actions.

[15.J We may judge praiseworthy that marriage which demands
only perfunctory labors and provides profits which will endure
forever.1n fact, any servant succeeds in his sensible endeavor to
serve his master if, after laboring at first m bondage to his lord, he
finally rejoices in his lord' s joy. Any servant who willingly slackens
in his service or is not afraid to break his saith to his lord will
rightfully do without his munificent lord' s fruitful deference. Itis
still a trivial commonplace on everyone' s lips that the firm faith and
persistent service of a house slave will secure him wide-open roads
to enter into his master's joy.

Every man who denies God's existence, who scoffs idly,
Is guilty of crudely seeking many godheadsÍ¾
