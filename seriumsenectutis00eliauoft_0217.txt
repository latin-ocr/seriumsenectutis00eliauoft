severity equal to that exercised in the case of lese-majesta, to the

should see that many people, disagreeing among themselves on
other articles of faith, have constantly asserted and proved this in
unison, and enforced it by the threat of eternal punishment, so it is
now considered to have achieved the invariable nature of necessity.

normally accrues to the original author, to the increase of his praise
and fame, but only if the circumspect imitator makes it a habit to
