glomery' ¹ for Cambridge was appointed by the archdeacon of Ely.⁴²

Wherever he taught grammar, Elias would have derived his living
primarily from students' fees rather than the insufficient income of the
cotland in Thriplow.⁴³

In the Serium senectutis Elias displays at least a layman's knowledge of
the new Aristotle and the canon law concerning marriage. The Serium
senectutis, De vita scolarium, and Petronius rediuiuus all betray a familiarity
with civil laW.⁴⁴¹ Is there then any likelihood that Elias studied law or,
as Bale claims, theology at Cambridge? Probably not, as the lack of
external evidence here is more damning than in the case of Elias as
grammar master.⁴⁵ If he did attend a university, Elias is more likely to
have pursued an arts course, that, along with his teaching of grammar,
would account for all but his knowledge of the new Aristotelian theology
and the two laws.⁴⁶ Perhaps the best way to square Elias‘s manifest
eruditiori with the silence of the records is to speculate that Elias did
pursue an arts course, most likely at Cambridge, but terminated his
studies some time before incepting as M.A.⁴⁷ Such a course would have
been sufficient training for a career as grammar master, since the masters
at the leading endowed schools normally held the Μ.Α., but most of the
masters elsewhere were not university graduates.⁴⁸ If he failed to com-
plete the requirements for the M.A., Elias would have been unable to
proceed to formal study in the higher faculties of theology and canon
law, but that would not have prevented him from achieving some
knowledge of both laws on his own from the conversation, teaching, and
even manuscripts which would have been available at Cambridge or

⁴⁵ “There is no sign of Elias as an alumnus of Cambridge under any possible forms of
his name, and until we have full texts available of such topographical sources as the
cartulary of St. John‘s hospital, 1 do not think we can hope to associate him with Cam-
bridge'' (D. M. Owen, persona! communication of 12 October 1984). Elias does not appear
in Emden‘s biographical registers of Cambridge and Oxford or in any of the other printed
sources for university history.

⁴⁶ Service at Ely as a grammar master or in some other capacity could have brought
Elias into contact with the Oxford masters who congregated in the familia of Bishop Eustace
as a result of the Oxford migration of 1209 (Hackett, Original Statutes, 45-47).

⁴⁷ Aston et a1., ’ἼἸιε Medieval Alumni of the University of Cambridge,'' 25-27, conclude
from their computer assisted analysis of Emden's biographical record that shortage of
funds, death, and other obstacles prevented as many as a third or a half of all students at
Cambridge from completing their studies.
