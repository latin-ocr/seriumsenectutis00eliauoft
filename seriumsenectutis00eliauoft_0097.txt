BOOK THREE 81

perchance it was led by more violent heresy or insane reverence for
the gods, it venerated them in solid metal, and made and wor-
shipped multitudes of wholly redundant gods. Any master who
avenged his injuries on a servant by making the offender equal to
himself in his joy or wealth would seem absurd. In fact, it is suffi-
cient reward for the merits of those who serve well that they be
allowed to enter into the joy of their master.

[5.] Antiquity also speaks of its gods as unabashed avengers of
abominable offenses or the injuries inflicted on them by proud men
who neglected their proper worship. Indeed, the rash ignorance of
Pentheus, who was punished by Dionysus for scoffing at his festi-
val, is a commonplace on the lips of everyone. The unusual method
of punishment chosen by the god is also a trite commonplace
known on every street corner; nor is the mode of drunkenly divine
vengeance hidden from the bleary-eyed, one-eyed, or barbers.
Indeed, forgetfulness will not have erased from the memory of
anyone who is even superficially literate how Pentheus, unswerving
‘m his love of religion, was killed by his own foolish and impious
mother Agave, besotted and urged on to folly by the drunken
power of Leneus. They will also remember how Bromius, or fire-
born Bacchus, sower and father of the jouy grape, souring of his
own will, was temporarily transformed into a child and discovered
on the seashore. He was held a seeming captive on shipboard as
long as he acquiesced, then avenged his injuries by turning his
overbold and violent captors into salt water fish, and leaving those
who were already sodden with drink to swim the deep forever.

[6.] The heavy vengeance which Jove, first and foremost of
fictitious, man-made gods, exacted for injuries he suffered is, ac-
cording to my judgment, no less well-known. After King Antiochus
and his Syrians had been wiped out by the Parthians, a certain
Alexander, son of a wholesaler named Procartus, was sent to Syria
by the Egyptian king Ptolemy to seek that kingdom for himself by
a fictional succession as well as by arms and conquest. Alexander
was received patiently and without a fight by the Syrians, for he
came ready to deceive them with a stratagem devised by Ptolemy,
namely that he had, according to the fictive justification, been
accepted into the royal family by King Antiochus while the latter
was still alive.
