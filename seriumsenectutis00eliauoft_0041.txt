Latin Aristotelianism,⁸⁹ and Elias shows none of the philosophical so-
phistication the study of Averroes and the work of Aquinas and his
contemporaries had brought to the subject by mid-century.

Elias's evidence for the immortality of the human soul comes from the
Bible and a range of pagan authors. Macrobius provides Elias's account
of the vision of Er, as he had provided Philip's summary of what Greek
philosophers had argued conceming the composition of the soul. Bac-
chus's dismemberment probably derives from Servius's commentary on
Vergil, which Elias would have known well from a career as grammar
master. Elias knows the Hermetic Asclepius directly and as it appears
excerpted in Augustine's City of God; his account of Seneca's visit to the
tomb of Scipio Africanus comes from the former‘s Epistolae morales.

Elias drew the bulk of his pagan mythology from Remigius of Auxerre's
Commentary on Martianus. In the case of Mercury's caduceus he uses the
Third Vatican Mythographer; his account of Apis may come from the
First Mythographer. But this is a tradition in which authors copied from
each other with the greatest freedom, so until we have modern editions
and some systematic monographs all attributions remain tentative. At the
same time, we should notice that Fulgentius does not figure as a source,
while Elias antedates late medieval mythographic compilations such as
Ridevall's Fulgentius metaforalis or the anonymous Imagines Fulgentii.

Elias's opening and central conceit come from Martianus Capella,
whom he quotes and explicates at length in his defense of figurative
language. Those explications rely heavily on Remigius's Commentary. He
borrows his definition of lying from Augustine's De mendacio, perhaps by
way of the Sentences. Philip's account of the ideal judge is based on
several passages in John of Salisbury's Policraticus. A passage in the same
author's Metalogicon probably sharpened Elias's sense of the possibilities
for reworking Martianus's conceit.

Throughout the work, Elias and Philip draw proof texts and stories
from the Bible, especially Psalms, Numbers, and Kings. For the interpre-
tation of those texts they rely on the glossa ordinaria. They retell several
stories—most notably the tale of Mercury and Battus-from Ovid's

many works by Femand van Steenberghen, including La phiIosophie au πίιί·ε siecle (Louvainz
Publications Universitaires; Paris: Beatrice-Nauwelaerts, 1966). For Oxford, the best account
remains D. A. Callus, ”Introduction of Aristotelian beaming to Oxford.'' See also J. M.
Fletcher, “Ti-ne Faculty of Arts,‘' and J. 1. Cano, '‘Theology and Theologians,'' in The Early
Oxford Schools, 369-99 and 471-517, and an exemplary edition by D. A. Callus and R. W.
