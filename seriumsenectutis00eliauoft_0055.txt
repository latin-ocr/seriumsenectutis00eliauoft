prffzffigularly vexing, but representative, example occurs at 3.164-67:

Uerum suas [suo suas Sl. ut (in tali casu sponte circumscribilis et
errabunda) coniectabat antiquitas! arbitrio numinis ulciscente Iouialis
iniurias, temeritate sacrilega sic transmissus vi [in S] tempestatis
totus arenarum molibus letaliter oppressus obiter interiit exercitus.

The complexity of this sentence results first from Elias's placement of one
parenthesis (in tali casu . .. errabunda) within another (ut coniectabat
antiquitas) and secondly from a welter of ablative constructions. One
could not blame the scribe(s) if they found this sentence rough going!
and it is clearly corrupt as it stands in the manuscript. My second emen-
dation, of in to vi, is necessary and obvious. However, the deletion of suo
before suas is fraught with difficulty. For suo suas is just the sort of
paronomasia in which Elias indulges elsewhere, and one might take suo as
modifying arbitrio just as suas surely modifies iniurias. But the possessive
numinis Iouialis renders either suo or suas not only unnecessary but
unacceptable. Perhaps we should emend suo to sua and take it as modi-
fying spon te. In that case we would have one possessive adjective modify-
ing a noun within the double parenthesis ut ... coniectabat antiquitas and
one modifying a noun outside it. If this is what Elias wrote, then he has
allowed adjectives to float almost completely clear of the nouns they
modify. Even so, Ι would hesitate to rule sua suas out, were it not that it
creates a jingling assonance which does not sound like the sort of thing
Elias might have written.

While Elias's difficult style does employ some elements of the pre-con-
quest Anglo-Latin hermeneutic style, it does not descend directly from
the style cultivated by Aldhelm and his followers.¹²⁴ Elias does share
with that style a fondness for rare adverbs,¹²⁵ alliteration, ¹²⁶ interlaced
word order7¹²⁷ and for rewriting more plainly worded sources. ¹²⁸ But
Elias displays no fondness for the cursus, either the tardus or the velox
beloved of Aldhelm and his followers.¹²⁹ My own study of the cadences
