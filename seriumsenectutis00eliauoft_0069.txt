and what Î™ said. In fact, as you would have learned already if you
had any sense, few things done in haste prove well-ordered in the
long run. According to my judgment, you showed insufficient care
for your position when you hastily reproved me for what I said,
especially since it is consonant with the integrity of truth, and is not
only unalloyed with the filth of falsehoodl but is, without exception!
