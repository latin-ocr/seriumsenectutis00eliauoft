32 INTRODUCTION

Elias also helps us see the modal influence of Menippean satire where
we may not have seen it before, in John of Salisbury's Policraticus and
Metalogicon. John's verses are quoted from the classical authors and are
not original compositions, but we remember that John read Petronius and
tells the Milesian tale of the Widow of Ephesus from the Satyrica. Given
the strong modal influence of tales from ancient history and literature on
the first half of the Serium senectutis, we may now suggest that the similar
subject matter of the Policraticus in particular places that work in the
class, for which Petronius is an exemplar, of Menippean satires which
use verse incidentally and not as a regular formal feature.¹⁰⁹

It should, however, be noted that even with Elias's defense of the
immortality of the human soul and of God's unique omnipotence, the
Serium senectutis does not contain the themes which Mras and other
scholars have isolated in the Menippean satire of the ancient world. Here
we find no heavenly journey, no council of the gods, no journey to the
underworld, no thirteenth labor of Hercules, no meeting with the muses,
no ὄνος λύρας.110 But we do find the Menippean juxtaposition of the
serious and ludicrous,¹¹¹ although the latter takes the form of mockery
or verbal and stylistic extravagance rather than genuine wit. And this
juxtaposition, visible also in the Petronius redi uiuus and what survives of
the De vita scolarium,¹¹² is central to the ethos and aesthetic of the Se-
rium senectutis.

We may conclude this section by noting the modal influence on the
Serium senectutis of one of the thirteenth century's most distinctive liter-

which also questions some of the assumptions upon which it has traditionally been based.

¹⁰⁹ However, we may note that particularly in the excerpta vulgaria the medieval text of
the Satyrica contained a much higher percentage of verse than the modern text, which
conflates O (the excerpta vulgaria), L and H. In any case, the advantage of Fowler‘s distinc-
tion between genres and modes is that it allows us to preserve generic boundaries while
discussing literary influences which work across those boundan‘es. In this manner, we can
escape the bind of Shanzer, who purchases a bracingly rigorous definition of the Menip-
pean genre at the cost of peremptorily dismissing Petronius's Satyrica as “a satyn'c novel
rather than a Menippean satire'' (A Philosophical and Literary Commentary on Martianus
Capella, 31).

¹¹¹ For classical testimony to this mixture, see the remarks attributed to Varro by Cicero:
“et tamen in illis veteribus nostris, quae Menippum imitati non interpretati quadam
hilaritate conspersimus, multa admixta ex intima philosophia, multa dicta dialectice, quae
quo facilius minus docti intellegerent, iucunditate quadam ad legendum invitati,· in
laudationibus, in his ipsis antiquitatum prooemiis philosophiae more scribere voluimus, si
modo consecuti sumus'' (Academica 1.8 [ed. Plasberg, 4.10-17], cited by Shanzer, Α Philo-
sophical and Literary Commentary on Martianus Capella, 30).
