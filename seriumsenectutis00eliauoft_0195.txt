BOOK NINE 179

Roman republic enlarged its borders by the law of conquest and
grew in happiness to become the envy of those living now. The
benevolence of the gods who were once so partial to the city of
Rome is sufficiently well known as a topic of street talk that we will
touch here on only one example expounded elsewhere at greater
length. The god Mercury, once greatly worshipped, is said to have
been reverently transported by ship from Epidaurus to Rome in the
shape of an abominable snake. The salutary presence of his god-
head eliminated a deadly pestilence which had long ravaged the
city. He was reverently established as a god at Rome under the
name of Aesculapius and was for a long time afterwards devoutly
placated by the Romans with incense and sacrifices, solemnities and
vows, in reverence of his godhead.

[9.] It seems to me a meretricious commonplace that the Egyp-
tians were so ridiculously deluded (a point on which many people
would agree) that they devoutly honored as a god Apis, a bull
customarily shown emerging from a river, marked prominently on
his right shoulder with the horned sign of the white moon. They all
converged towards him of one accord and hymned him with every
sort of music, and while they stood looking upwards, he was lifted
into the air and carried above themÍ¾ or his guards were themselves
moved, or stood still and then disappeared later on the same day.

[10.] Divided thus among various sects of the gods or the divine
numen, caring absolutely nothing for the unity of the godhead, the
various ancients passed their time in long and unbroken prosperity.
Go right ahead then, if you want to, and boast in vain about the
immortality of your soul and the life essence which will endure
foi-ever, and either despair of logic or proof, or if you have any at
hand, you should use them to shore up your argument when your
time comes.
