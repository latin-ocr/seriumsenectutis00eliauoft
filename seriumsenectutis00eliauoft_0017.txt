1. The Life and works of Elias of Thriplow

1. The Rediscovery of Elias

Elias of Thriplow was first brought to the attention of modern
scholars by Beryl Smalley, who included him in the Appendix of Lost or
Previously Unknown Works to her English Priars and Antiquity in the Early
Fourteenth Century.¹ He figures there as a source for Thomas Ringstede's
fourteenth-century Commentary on Proverbs and the mid fifteenth-century
Pabularium poetarum compiled at St. Albans under the aegis of Abbot
John Whethamstede. Both Ringstede and the Pabularium cite a prosime-
trum by Elias, De vita scolarium atque sua, or “On His Own Life and That
of His Students''; in addition, Ringstede paraphrases material from
another work by Elias, Contra nobilitatem, or “Against Empty Nobility.''
Working only from the prose and verse fragments available to her in
Ringstede and the Pabularium, Smalley offers a brilliant reconstruction of
Elias's aims and style in De vita scolarium:

He must have admired Pseudo-Boethius, De disciplina scolarium and
set out to imitate him. Pseudo-Boethius wrote entirely in prose; Elias
improved on him by adapting the alternate prose·and·verse form of
the true Boethius to the subject-matter of Pseudo-Boethius.²

So apt is Smalley's characterization that in Olga Weijers's edition of De
disciplina scolarium it becomes historical fact:

Au XIVe siecle le Ps-Boece a aussi ete imite par un certain Elias
Tripolanensis, dont l'ouvrage De vita scolarium atque cura est perdu
saut quelques citations par deux autres Anglais.³

As we shall see! Elias of Thriplow's works are contemporary with, or
earlier than! the De disciplina scolarium, which Weijers dates to 1230-
1240.⁴ And despite the similarity of subject matter, there is no evidence
