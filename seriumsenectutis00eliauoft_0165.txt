BOOK FIVE 149

understand what you intend and pay careful attention to compre-
hend the sense of your words. Even though you may have said
something which displeased or sat wrong with me (Ι refer only to
your means of expression), I will not continue the argument by
making a contentious reply or using hostile language. It no longer
appeals to me to take turns stating and restating our arguments,
varying our wording or modifying our positions as we go. So you
are free to say whatever pleases you, without fear of any harsh
contradiction, provided that you do not exceed all measure in your
discourse through disharmonious falsehood or lies, or through
some absurd violation of probability. It is not normally a cause for
reproach that a man should listen in silence to someone speaking
good sense and not utter any contradictory replies, which are often
the cause of disharmonious squabbles and protract such hostilities
as are to be constantly avoided by any wise man.

[2.] One cannot say that battle is rightfuny joined when only the
victim is thrashed by an ignorant assailant who delivers all the
blows; likewise, a squabble is unlikely to develop when only one of
a pair of companions is permitted to loosen his lips in discourse.
Nor does a dispute or an acrimonious exchange of words normally
result from ordinary good nature when one of the conversationalists
takes a vacation in silence, so to speak, and the other is permitted
to say whatever is on his lips or whatever he wishes to articulate
freely. In fact, acrimonious controversy will normally be slow to
occur between those who discuss serious matters when one, bet-
tered by moderation and honeyed mildness, says nothing harsh or
useless in reply. You are entitled to speak out, taking your pleasure
for your guide without regard for the universal law of dispute; I
can and will renounce the license of speech by my free will, since I
choose to luxuriate in pure silence.
