opinions of authoritative men concerning the definition or descrip-
tion οἱ the human soul.

[3.] Plato, preeminent in philosophy from the early days of
venerable Antiquity, held the pleasing opinion that the soul is a
self- -moving essence. But Aristotle said the soul is an entelechy, that
is, a perfected form. Pythagoras, and Philolaus who agreed with
him, said the soul is harmony, that is, concord or consonance;
Posidonius, idea, that is, a mental' image, and Asclepiades said the
soul is the harmonious exercise of the five senseS. But Hippocrates
said the soul is a tenuous spirit diffused through the entire body.
Heraclides the natural philosopher said the >soul is a spark of the

soul consists of both earth and fire, Xenophantes of both earth and
water, Boethos of both air and fire. But Epicurus called the soul an

of poets, commendably hinted at the soul's nature in saying: ¹¹Its
vigor is fiery and its image heavenly.'' Thus he seems to a sensible
investigator to agree with Hipparchus, either Heraclides, Plato, and
also Pythagoras.

[4.] It greatly amazes me and at the same time exacerbates my
dismay that all the philosophers have leagued together to agree
without any turbulent dissent on the immortality and the incorpore-
ality of the soul, with the result that the unique vigor of their own
lives justly excludes these Pharisees from any claim to philosophie
dignity. But it has never ceased to amaze me that all men without
exception suppose, indeed claim to know beyond a doubt as certain
knowledge, that only the human soul is endowed with immortality,
while not doubting that the spirits and souls of other animals are
