RECONSTRUCTING A LIFE 7

well-connected family, especially as his education would, if nothing else,
have required some form of patronage from family or other sources.³⁰
However, we do have enough evidence to conclude that he was not an
important member of the family and that he was perhaps not a family
member at all.

Elias's title le mastre in the 1222 survey is hard to interpret exactly. By
the thirteenth century the title magister (maistre, master) is more likely to
specify the status accorded recipients of university training than it is to
indicate the occupation of grammar master (magister scolae) or elementary
teacher (ludimagister).³¹ But as “Helyas le mastre'' in the Cotton manu-
script can be identified confidently with the Helias Tripolaunensis whose
De vita scolarium atque sua is cited by Ringstede and Whethamstede, we
may consider it quite likely that Elias was active as a grammar master in
or before 1222. ln those excerpts that survive from De vita scolarium Elias
makes frequent reference to what Schmidt labels “the miseria of the teach-
ing profession.''³² Smalley quotes a passage from Ringstede in which
Elias complains of masters who are so incompetent that they must bribe
students to attend their lectures.³³ ln Whethamstede's tabula we find
under magister a similar complaint about masters who set about flattering
their students like parasites at a rich man's table. Under parens Elias
complains of those parents who provide so magnificently for their
children at school that the excess distracts them from their studies.³⁴

It is tempting to imagine Elias as a grammar master in Ely or Cam-
bridge, but the records which might prove or disprove such a thesis are
lacking for both places.³⁵ Even so, there can be little doubt that such
