GENRE 29

classical allegoresis is intellectually striking and rhetorically effective.
While Elias's immediate target is the literal minded Philip, it is clear that
he addresses all those who would deny the significance of figurative
expressions when he says:

You seem unafraid . . . to vituperate the salutary metaphorical
language of Solomom who was confirmed in the highest spiritual
wisdom. Indeed, as can be inferred plainly from your vociferous
ravings, scarcely anything could be more absurd or discordant
than for the Bride to be coupled in marriage with the Grooml and
the Church married to the Lamb, or for the Bride to long to be
solaced by the kiss of her spouse's mouth (4.85-94).

If Elias begins his defense of figurative expression with examples of biblica]
allegoresis, he ends it with Remigius's account of the particularly obscure
passage which follows Philology's drink from the cup of immortality in
book 2 of Martianus's De nuptiis. Ultimately, Elias's explication of the “sober
. . . sense‘' hidden within Martianus's fiction constitutes his main defense of
his own use of figurative expression and fictional narrative.

Elias is all the more eager to defend the significance of Martianus's
fiction because it was from Martianus that Elias drew his central conceit
of a marriage between mind (Philology) and tongue (Mercury). Elias's
first metrum speaks of the god and his mortal bridel but from his first
prosa on Elias literalizes Martianus's metaphor by speaking of a bond
between the wise man's thoughts and words quo bene conveniant pectus et
oris opus. Pamela Gradon has shown that such literalization of allegory is
typical of late medieval literature.¹⁰¹ At the same time that Elias litera-
lizes Martianus's conceit he also discreetly Christianizes it! so that early
in the second prosa of his first book he can map out the course his entire
treatment will take:

Ireckon that for any rational man the marriage of mind and tongue
is no less useful and expedient than any other marriage. What is
morel the conjugal confederation of such a well-matched couple

leads by a direct route to the tabernacle of the supreme Governor
and the infinite dwelling of incircumscribable celsitude (1.100-104).

This theme culminates in Philip's claiml when he accepts Elias's proofsl
that
