BOOK FOUR 141

[23] But such obdurate and stubborn pride would not have
caused you to act foolishly if you had been accustomed to consider-
ing the inner logie of discourses in this manner. When Philology or
Philosophy (that is, the firm love of reason or wisdom perfected by
contemplation) has transcended sublunar (earthly, that is) studies,
Athanasia willingly transports the transcendent one to unending
immortality, while Apotheosis, her mother and nurse, lends her
assistance. For purgation, deification, or consecration is rightly
mother and efficient cause of immortality. Therefore, among those
who are clear-headed or reasonably intelligent, it is not a great
cause for astonishment or crude and hasty condemnation that,
having been made immortal by purgation and deification or conse-
cration, Philosophy rendered thanks to her benefactresses by hum-
ble and pure sacrifice, most honorably devout. So you may consider
the sacrifice of thanksgiving, like benefactresses and benefaction, as
only figures.

[24] To continue, your rash prejudice would lead you to the
brutish presumption of objecting either implicitly or explicitly that
it is wrong-headed to attribute either scorching by fire or bathing in
water to those blessed by immortality. But had you been willing
and able to set aside your obstinate effrontery and examine before-
hand the mind of the speaker or the integrity of his logie or inten-
tion, perhaps you would have softened your harsh judgment or, as
a result of your own amelioration, changed it for the better. In
speaking of such matters, Martianus did not seek to assert their
truth, but to rework the false assertions of Antiquity to his own
ends. For Antiquity, deranged to the point of absurdly inventing
feigned gods, chanced to imagine that Vedius (Pluto, that is, or
Orcus) and his wife Proserpina or Allecto ambushed souls as they
departed from their now distant bodies, absolved by jud gment from
the condition of further death, so that once again god and goddess
struck terror and perturbation into those who were easily flustered
by their new condition. Antiquity also feigned that the Eumenides,
that is, the infernal furies, tortured new souls. And it feigned that
Vedius burned the new-made souls with his fire and washed them
