BOOK ELEVEN 197

situation the altogether human healer Elisha supplicated the su-
preme Healer about whom we presume to speak at present.

[22.] I do not believe that the true Healer's third revivification of
one who had relinquished life, worthy as it is of frequent repetition,
should be passed over in ignorant silence by the current of our
discourse, since it pertains to our present topic. When in the course
of His travels, Jesus, the supreme savior, judge and arbiter of those
who breathe under the sun, entered the city of Naim with his
disciples and a multitude of followers, the only son of a certain
widow was being carried away dead, attended by a great number
of people. But when this merciful and powerful prelate saw the
widowed mother bedewed (as often happens) by weeping and
lamentation, He was moved to mercy and said to the wailing
woman: ‘'Woman, do not weep.‘' Then He approached the dead
boy and touched the bier, and as the bearers halted, He said:
“Young man, I say to thee arise.'' And immediately he that was
dead sat up and began to speak, and Jesus returned him alive to his
mother, who no longer mourned. This remarkable deed compelled
all those who were present to feel extreme fear and amazement.
And they always devoutly glorified this admirable God for so many
great deeds and marvels.

[23] In fact, subtle investigators may take this extraordinary act
of recalling the soul to a dead body as an effective proof of the
immortality of the soul, which remains capable of being recalled
even after the body has been deprived of all vital vigor. However,
Christ, man and God, did not keep this great power to recall the
soul to a dead body for himself alone: instead, He allowed many
others to possess the ability to do such things in His name. So you
may always note with confidence the immortality of the man who
sufficiently supplicates God, but especially in the case of His second
restoration of a soul.
