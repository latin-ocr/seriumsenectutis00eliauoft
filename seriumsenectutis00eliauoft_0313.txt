Index nominum et rerum

This index covers introduction, text, translation, commentary and
appendices. However, modern scholars are indexed only when they
appear in the text of the introduction or appendices. Biblical passages
cited in the text of the Serium senectutis are all accessible through the
index auctorum and so are not indexed here. Other ancient and medieval
authors and works are indexed here because many of them are cited in
the introduction and commentary but are not direct sources for the
Serium senectutis and so do not appear in the index auctorum. Names are
normally cited in the normalized forms used in the translation, although
1 have usually followed the Douay-Rheims Bible in rendering the names
of Old Testament figures and so add the more familiar name forms of the
Revised Standard Version in parentheses. Rhetorical figures are indexed
according to their Latin names. References to the Serium senectutis are to
the Latin text, all references are to pages in this edition.
