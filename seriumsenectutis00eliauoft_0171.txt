BOOK SEVEN 155

perpetual matrimony as if by a certain matrimonial laW, Ι do not at
all wish to concern myself with Hymen, the absurdly fictitious god
of nuptials (according to the superficial sense), or with dotal docu-

ments or a married woman' s property. Nor do 1 care at all about
ssoral garlands of lights or unifying wreaths, nor about Genius,
father of Hymen, nor about the venereal lap of his mother, and set
aside from my commentary such sports as are performed between
idle sheets by the pleasure-loving mother of Hermaphrodite.

analogies with commonplace marriages, which are ubiquitous by
nature, Ι will to the best of my ability consider the matrimonial
partnership of two who are so thoroughly and salubriously compat-
ible, and nuptials which are according to rule, so to speak, despite
a certain quite sensible irregularity, and most unique in the power
they can confer upon all. I will pay no heed to connubial Juno,
always favorably inclined to give prompt aid to those willing to
accept it, the putative nuptial guardian and feigned pronuba. Ι will
altogether banish from my lips the Muses' melodious modulations,
their harmonice or solo modulations, and the harmonious jangling
of flutes, water organs, and harmonious lyres.

80, since decrepitude has begun to slow me down,

My torpid age shall banish all depravity

And prepare itself anew for useful things:

To live a life of virtue, war stoutly against the vices,
