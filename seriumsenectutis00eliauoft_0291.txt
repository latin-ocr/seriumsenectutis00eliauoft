Index verborum

This index lists all post-classical words or senses of words, along
with rariora and technical terms of any provenance, appearing in the
Serium senectutis. It treats as post-classical words or senses which do not
appear in the Oxford Latin Dictionary (OLD), but for matters of documen-
tation or interpretation, the OLD has been consulted in tandem with the
Thesaurus linguae Latinae (TLL). 'I’he OLD, TLL and Dictionary ofMedieval
Latin from British Sources (MLD) have been consulted for every word they
cover. However, only the OLD is complete. In the Thesaurus linguae
Latinae, 1 have been able to consult volumes 1-9 and volume 10, part 1,
fascicules 1-4, and part 2, fascicules 1-5 (A-M, 0-pastor, porta—praepo-
tens). In the Dictionary ofMedieval Latin from British Sources, I have been
able to consult fascicules 1-4 (A-inconsonans).¹

For all words outside the scope of the TLL and MLD as published to
date, I have consulted Alexander Souter's Glossary of Later Latin (S) and
R. E. Latham's Revised Medieval Latin Word-List from British Sources (L)
respectively. These books supply reliable corpora of late and medieval
Latin and are usefully related to the larger works they stand in for.
Souter admits his debt to the Thesaurus linguae Latinae, to which he
contributed material, in his preface, and the Revised Word-List was com-
piled from an earlier version of the data base now being used to write
the MLD. However, readers should note a slight difference in my use of
S and L. Because Souter carefully outlines the independent reading
program which underlies his Glossary, 1 sometimes cite S when the TLL
is silent; however, since the editors of the Medieval Latin Dictionary,
beginning with Latham himself, have scrutinized anew all the material in
the Word-List, I never cite L when MLD is silent.

For words and senses which do not appear in the OLD, TLLJS or
MLD] L, 1 sometimes suggest analogues or probable sources. Normally,
I do not cite senses not used by Elias, even when those senses are docu-
mented and the sense employed by Elias is not. However, 1 stretch this
rule somewhat in the case of words having technical senses related to the
trivium, where it seems likely that Elias' usage might have been influ-
enced or triggered by his knowledge of the technical term.

¹1 am grateful to D. R. Howlett, editor of the Dictionary osMedieval Latin, for collating
this index against the contents of fascicule 4 in advance of publication.
