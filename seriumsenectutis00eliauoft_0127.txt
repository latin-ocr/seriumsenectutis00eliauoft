sluggish wine.

[39.] Brennus had 55,000 foot soldiers from his full army, the
people of Delphi and their allies had only 4,000 soldiers. Scorning
his enemy' s forces, Brennus sharpened the spirits of his followers
by reminding those ready for battle of the great store of spoils at
the shrine, pointing out with his finger the innumerable quantity of
statues and chariots cast from solid gold. He added that the re-
splendent exterior of the booty was nothing compared to its great
weight. Inspired by such claims, and at the same time still inebriat-
ed aster a nightlong bout of drinking, the Gauls rushed into battle
as a mob without any thought for danger. But the people of Delphi,
trusting more in the Delian than in their own forces or the number
of their allies, put up a stiff sight, not without contemptuous scorn
for their opponents. Rushing down headlong, they overwhelmed
the Gauls, in part by dropping rocks from the extreme summit of
the precipitous mountain, in part with fatal steel.

[40.] At the first encounter of the rival armies, the high priests of
all the temples and the seer himself, hair dishevelled and wearing
emblems and headbands, are said to have suddenly run, fearful and
frenzied, to the front lines of the two armies. They shouted that the
god had come, and that they had seen him leaping down into the
temple through the open peak of its roof. While they all joined in
imploring the aid of the Delphic godhead, they saw a youth en-
dowed with more than human beauty, and his companions, two
armed virgins, come running to him from the neighboring shrines
of Minerva and Diana. Not only did they see this with their eyes,
but (if one can have saith in the words of Antiquity, which wavered
in the way of truth) they also heard the hissing of bows and the din
of arms. Incited by this vision, they urgently entreated the people of
Delphi not to hesitate in vain desperation when they saw the gods
advancing before them into battle as standard-bearem, but to slay
their foes manfully and actively associate themselves with the gods
in victory.
