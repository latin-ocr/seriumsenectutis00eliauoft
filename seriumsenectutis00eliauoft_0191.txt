BOOK NINE 175

[3.] Even the Israelites, who had once elected and unanimously
chosen for themselves only one God, became worshippers of the
gods and venerated a plurality of gods. One of the best endowed
ancient intellectuals spoke in full earnest about these gods who
seem like literary fictions: “As the God and father, who is the
highest or preeminent god, is the creator of the celestial gods, so
man is the creator of those gods who are worshipped in temples,
content with the willing proximity of the human condition. 1 mean
those gods who are reverently worshipped in the recesses and
shrines of their temples, and who are not only illuminated by their
worshippers, but also return the favor by rewarding their worship-

[4.] The same author adds later: “The image of the gods which
humanity created took its form from either nature, that is, from the
divine, which is prior and far more divine, and from that which
lives and moves among men and is made from matter, fashioned
not only with heads but with members and entire bodies. Thus
humanity, always mindful of its nature and origin, persists in this
imitation of religion, so that as God, father of all things and univer·

the same way man fashioned his transitory gods in the likeness of
his visage.'' This same eloquently sensible man later makes the
confident assertion that these statues are not only imbued with
sense and spirit but animated by a soul and prescient of future

turn. He adds soon afterwards: “It is easy for terrestrial and earthly
gods to become wrathful, as they are compounded by men from
either nature, that is, from a demon or angel conjured by name, and
from a statue.''

[5.] Not only did the revered men of earlier times consider it
worth their while to imitate the likenesses of men in making their
gods, but they also made for themselves images of brute animals to
be adored as gods. To give an obvious example, the people of
Israel, when they were liberated miraculously from onerous servi-
tude in Egypt but afssicted by the difficulties of fleeing through the
desert, did not hesitate to prostrate themselves and worship a calf
forged from gold as a god—a people worthy of such a crude and
bovine god, unless such a god was to be worshipped with bended
knee on account of the gold, which they always desired greatly, and
unless they believed only in gold. The voice of people who acted so
