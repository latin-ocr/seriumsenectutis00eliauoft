BOOK THREE 105

by freely sweetening their entreaties with large amounts of money.
Only the Macedonian king Ptolemy, traitor and parricide, destined
for misfortunes and a horrible death by the will of Jove, awaited the
coming of the Gauls without fear, perhaps placing all his hope in
his skill at betrayal. Driven perhaps by the furies of the relatives he
had slain, he confronted the approaching Gauls with a few disor-
derly followers, as if victory in battle could be achieved with as
little peril or difficulty as betrayals and parricides. But to make the
extent of his stupidity more apparent, he was so madly arrogant as
to reject an embassy of Illyrians offering him 20,ooo auxiliaries, and
even to add some foolish insults. “It is all over for the Macedo·

the Gallie envoys, as he had to his familiars, that he would not
grant them peace unless they resigned their leaders and arms to
him. He proudly claimed that he could only trust Gauls who were
naked and unarmed. The Gauls laughed at the response of a fool so
proud of himself, scornfully shouting that it would soon be known
whether they consulted their own good or the Macedonians' in
offering peace.

[34] After the lapse of a few dayS, battle was joined with noisy
shocks back and forth. The Macedonians were defeated with horri-
ble slaughter, and Ptolemy, just now so defiant and proud, was
captured with numerous wounds. As Jove at last exacted the penal-
