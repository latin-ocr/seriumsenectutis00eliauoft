LANGUAGE AND STYLE 35

especially fond of a series of adverbs in -iter which may be his own
coinages: cachinnabiliter, derisibiliter, diouolariter, horripilaliter, subsannabi-
liter, and the like.¹¹⁶ Both Elias and Philip sprinkle these derisive ad-
verbs liberally through their speeches. By applying them to stories of
pagan impiety and Jewish apostasy, Elias and Philip sound a note of
learned, Christian detachment. When they hurl them at each other, they
achieve at least a faint echo of Bakhtinian carnivalization, although the
basis of their humor is mockery rather than wit. Cumulatively, Elias uses
these adverbs and their cognates to define a negative pole of folly and
futility antithetical to his moral and intellectual ideal of the man who
thinks and acts sensibly (sensatus, sensate).

Elias is also fond of creating compound verbs beginning with con-, pre-
and re-. Rarely do they mean anything different from the simple verb.
Notice also the many adjectives ending in -iuum, such as abanimatiuum
(3.58), derogatiuum (4.69), incitatiuum (3753, 420, 8.81-82), and subsecutiu-
um (3.25).¹ ⁷ He creates a range of phrases using ad to indicate purpose
or use: ad vsum, ad genituram, ad habundans, ad bene conveniens. This
practice derives from the classical ad plus gerund (gratias ad exibendas); its
strangest fruit is the seemingly adverbial ad expediens.

Elias uses medieval forms of classical words (affectiuus, capesco, capio,
conferueo, dissidium, frustratim, itero, lacesco, mendositas, merit0, optate,
protensus, quamplures, ridiculosusl-e, sanccio, verisimillime), words which
merged or became commonly confused in medieval Latin (diducoldeduco,
endelichialentelechia, oppugnolexpugno, perproperefprepropere, vernali terfvernili-
ter), and words which he himself seems to have elided together or
confused (mansuescolconsuesco, facilitasfoacillitas [not attested, from vacil-
lo]). In a few cases (mastigolmastico, paruiloquiumsprauiloquium) it is hard
to tell whether one is dealing with distinct words, confusion on the part
of the author, or scribal error.

We will also find alliteration and paronomasia in the prose passages. A
particular variation of the latter involves ringing the changes on personal
pronouns: meo me michi (12.46), tu tibi tuis (1.66-67), suis se sibi (2.304-5).
Other examples are sprinkled throughout the work: cauillator arte cauilla-
toria (3.42), Gallos gallorum (3.528), rurali rusticus rustice vagaretur in
agro (7.40-41), diuersis diuersorum philosophicis in exerciciis philosophorum
(8.36-37), molaque molestiarum molestato (12.44). Nor is alliteration hard to
find: res ridiculosissima sit senes interesse scurrilitatibus, iocarive iuueniliter in
thalamis, vanitatibusue vacare veneriis (1.4o-41), te solum supine sci um censeas
