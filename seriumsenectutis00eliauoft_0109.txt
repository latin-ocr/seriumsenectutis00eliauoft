conceived naval battle. Afterwards, he was persuaded by the prom-
pting of his own fear and the deft arguments of his advisor Mardo-
nius to take thought for his safety by fleeing to his kingdom, leav-
ing only Mardonius with 300,000 troops in Greece. Mardonius
urged that he do so lest anyone instigate a rebellion against his rule
upon hearing rumors of his defeat. He added that with such a small
force he would either subjugate Greece to the great glory of the
Persians or, if things should turn out otherwise, he would fall to
their foe without disgracing the departed king. Urged by frenzied
and shameless fear to assent to this reasoning, the king willingly
yielded to persuasion (proving that in this respect he was altogether
complaisant and cautious) and retreated immediately with the
greater part of his army.

[18.] But the Greeks, when they heard about the timid king's
hasty flight, took counsel whether to sever the bridge which he had
constructed at Abydos when he first entered Europe, as if he were
victor over sea and men. Τὴε prudent Themistocles argued against
doing so, suspecting that the enemy troops, if made to fear for their
lives by being bottled up in this manner, would (as often happens)
turn desperation into valor and bravely cut a path to safety by
laying on with their swords. He added that as things stood many of
the enemy remained in Greece, and pleaded that it made no sense
to increase the numbers of their foe by restraining them against
their will. But when he could not prevail upon the others by his
pleading in council, this man, flourishing in good counsel, reverted
to his redeeming subtlety and cleverly sent a suborned servant,
whom he already knew to be prone to confusion at the slightest
alarm, to Xerxes. He found him confounded by fear, and confound-
ed him further by counseling him to cross the bridge in the swiftest
possible ssight.

[19.] Struck senseless by confusion, as was his wont, Xerxes
entrusted the leaders of his several armies with the task of leading
his soldiers home. Fearful and with few followers, Xerxes hastened
to Abydos, trembling as he entered the fishing skiff which was to
carry him across the Hellespont. This outcome of events deserves
close inspection as an admirable intimation of how man's lot varies
according to the vicissitudes of life. Behold the prince, whom a
short time before the entire expanse of the sea had scarcely held
glorying in the infinite vastness of his army, hiding in a small craft.
See the man whose troops weighed down the earth on account of
their infinite multitude so soon without any assistance from ser-
vants.
