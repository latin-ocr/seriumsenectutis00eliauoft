be at least thirty years earlier than Bale suggests. We might have guessed
as much from his appearance in the Cotton survey of 1222. We can be
sure of this when Elias fails to appear in a similar survey from 1251
contained in the Ely Old Coucher or Liber R. Although this later survey
makes no mention of Elias, it does name Albric, son of Elias, and willel-
mus le Maistre as cotarii in Thriplow.²⁵ Most likely, the cotland had
passed to Albric at the death of his father Elias, confirming the claim that
the cotland was a family holding, and providing a clear terminus ad quem
of 1251 for Elias's death.

Elias's full name, as we know from Ringstede and the Sloane manu-
script of the Ser-ium senectutis, was Helias Rubeus Tripolanensis.²⁶ Both
of the Ely surveys list other landholders in Thriplow named Ruffus (le
Rus or Russel): Robertus Ruffus, who also held land elsewhere from the
bishop, in 1222 (fol. 219v), and Coteman le Rede and Willehnus Russel in
1251 (72ν). And various members of the Ruffus (le Rus or Russel) family
were prominent citizens in Cambridge before or at mid-cenmry.²⁷ They
were, furthermore, connected to several men who played central roles in
the development of the University of Cambridge. Richard de Leycestria,
who may have been the first chancellor of the university, witnessed a
charter for Maurice Ruffus or le Rus before circa 1232,²⁸ and while
regent master in civil law circa 1254-1257 Simon de Asceles lived in a
great stone house on Trumpington Street owned by John le Rus.²⁹ The
latter is particularly suggestive, since in 1257 Asceles became an Augus-
tinian canon at Barnwell, where he was prior from 1267 to 1297. Some
network of friendship and blood relation between Simon, John le Rus,
and Helias Rubeus might explain how the copy of Contra nobilitatem
inanem noted by Leland found its way into the library of Barnwell.

But we will search in vain for any confirmation of a link between the

heads of the Ruffus family—Alberic, Maurice, John, Aunger, and Alice—

and our Elias. They appear in entry after entry in the Cartulary of St.
John's Hospital and the early records of Peterhouse as donors or witness-
es,· nowhere are they joined by Elias Ruffus or le Rus. We should not
altogether dismiss the possibility that Elias was a poor relative of this
