Commentary

For the sake of precision, 1 cite prose sources by both their place in the original
text (book, chapter, section, or line) and their page and line location in the edition
to which 1 refer. 1 have tried to distinguish between certain or near certain
sources, on the one hand, and possible sources or analoguae, on the other, by
introducing all references to the latter by ¹¹cf.'' Abbreviated titles for books of the
Bible are those used by Robert Weber et al. in their edition of the Vulgate. 'Ihis
commentary also employs the following abbreviations:

Book One

1-28 This poem on the marriages of the gods is inspired by the invocation of
Hymen with which Martianus Capella begins his De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii
1.1 (ed. Willis 1.4ff). For surveys of Martianus's influence, see C. Leonardi, “Nota
introduttiva per un'indagine sulla fortuna di Marziano Capella nel Medievo,'' and
Gabriel Nuchelmans, “Philologia et son mariage avec Mercure jusq‘a la fin du xii‘
siecle? Willis provides extensive bibliography in his Teubner edition (Leipzig,
1983). Books 1 and 2 often circulated apart from the rest of the work in the
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, see Leonardi, “1 codici di Marziano Capella.''
Elias also imitates Martianus by continuing his sense units from pentameter to

hexameter in violation of the classical norm for elegiae verse.

2 felici federe: Cf. Catullus, Carmina (ed. Mynors) 64373.

4-9 Elias echoes Martianus 1.3 (2.17ff.).

4 veruta: Such a word is attested by Aulus Gellius, Noctes Atticae 18.2.12 (ed.
Marshall, 540.24-26): “Secundum ea hoc quaesitum est, uerbum ‘uerant,' quod
significat ‘uera dicunt,¹ quisnam poetarum ueterum dixerit.‘' But it is inconceiv—
able that a grammarian would scan veram. Verita would fit the meter but does
not yield an acceptable sense unless Elias means the perfect to have a passive
sense. 'I'he translation assumes such a sense, equivalent to that of verenda, “to be
held in awe or reverence.'¹

6 The Abderite and Coan are Vulcan and Venus respectively.

7 For Argiona (¹‘the Argive‘¹), cf. Martianus 1.4 (3.11).

11-12 For Admetus and Alcestis, see below 1.89-93.

13 ceteris cupido: The classical idiom would be better served by emending to
ceteri, but the dative shows signs of encroaching on the genitive elsewhere in
