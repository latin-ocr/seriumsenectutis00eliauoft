BOOK TEN 183

recently died and been buried or been lying stretched out in the
ground for some time is approached accidentally or on purpose by
that person's slayer, even at a distance, blood will suddenly flow
from the corpse with a loud noise, even if that corpse is already, as
is often the case, cold. Transparent storytellers and natural philoso-
phers claim that this occurs because of a certain reason they feign
according to their lies and dreams. They say (not inelegantly, as it
seems to me) that when a man is slain, a certain syzygy (which is to
say a spirit that conjoins two contraries, or rather opposites, difficult

becomes a mean without a middle (indeed, a stable partnership
between opposites is rare) which, remaining with the murdered
corpse out of affection, is roused by indignation or an access of
wrath to stir the blood which was always friendly to it, and for this

body) stays behind and decomposes because it is transitory, while
the other (the animating and vital soul) will, if it so deserved, live
in perpetual bliss without fearing any injury from death. For father
Genius has not granted death any proper jurisdiction over incorpo-
real things, especially since death cannot, of its own nature, reach as
far as the incorporeal. In fact, we can establish the fact that man is
the only animal under the sun privileged with an immortal soul as
a certain truth by an infinite number of proofs, even by the unscru-
pulous denials of irritable critics. Indeed, it is almost meretriciously
usual and trite that in any sect or community of faith, once all
doubts are set aside, proofs of the permanence and immortality of
the human soul appear at first glance, confirmed by the well-tried
integrity of religion and frequently accompanied by plausible
explanations.

[4.] To begin then at our pleasure, we will proceed to ancient
opinions which were seriously asserted about the topics we have
sampled by venerable men adorned by ancient faith and constant
reverence. This will enable us to publicize certain events according
to the accounts of those who actually experienced them, men whose
