RECONSTRUCTING Α LIFE 3

2. Reconstructing a Life

Schmidt has also shown that Elias was not so much previously
unknown as long forgotten. In fact, Elias was known to the Tudor
antiquarians John Leland (e. 1506-1552) and John Bale (1495-1563) and
their followers.¹² Among the manuscripts possessed by the Augustinian
priory at Barnwell just outside Cambridge, Leland records in his Collec-
tanea a work “Helias Rubeus Tripolaunensis contra inanem nobilita-
tem.'¹¹³ This is all the mention Leland makes of Elias,¹⁴ so it comes as
a surprise to find that Bale claims the collectanea as his authority for the
account of Elias he includes in the first volume of his chronological
Scriptorum illustrium Maioris Brytannie Catalogus, or “Catalogue of
Illustrious British Writers.'¹ Given the paucity of external evidence for
Elias's life and works, Bale's account is worth translating in full:

Helias Rubeus, a native of Thriplow in Cambridgeshire, having
successfully devoted his youth to the proper studiesl at length
turned his mind to greater and loftier subjects and, it is said, totally
dedicated himself to the mysteries of theology at Cambridge. He
was a man, as Leland testifies in his Collectanea, outstanding for
humanity and prudence, nobly instructed in many branches of
knowledge. Having often frequented the royal court, he saw many
men vainly boasting not virtue itself but a noble name and fleshly
lineage, although he knew they had fallen far short of their ances-
tors‘ nobility. Attacking them with heroic spirit and the daring of
Hercules, he revealed their shallowness with lively reasoningl
demonstrating that genuine nobility is to be reckoned according to
virtue, not blood.

He wrote Contra inanem nobilitatem in one book and certain other
works of which, however, 1 have not thus far seen the titles.

Leland does not say at what time or under which king he either
lived or died,· Leland does, however, make honest mention of him.
So he will stay here until he finds his proper place.¹⁵
