BOOK THIRTEEN 221

progress together in unvarying charity. It suits all the living to
agree to live together as one, especially those who are allied by the
salutary concord of companionship, and associated in unity of
professed faith. Henceforth, then, we will dwell persistently in the
charm of undeviating and sincerely confirmed partnership, so we
might live life in the future in the robust tranquillity of salutary
sodality, and by dwelling together, delight in the beneficial integrity
of faith. Constant partnership in mutual integrity and delight has
and still can perpetuate at least a superficially undying fame and
immortality, even for pagans.

[3.] Having terminated our long dispute, we will take respite and
delight ourselves by giving an example of faithful partnership, for
it is often pleasant to stroll (so to speak) in true material, unmixed
with falsehood, and pleasurable to vigorous men. The story con-
cerns the faithful friendship of Damon and Pythias, although it has
not been meretriciously recounted by the lips of everyone. Initiated
at the same time as partners in the teachings of the Pythagorean
sect, Damon and Pythias progressed in understanding by learning
together according to Pythagorean method and living together
indivisibly of one accord. Establishing for themselves a bond of
partnership, they persisted in devoting themselves to each other
with faithful and unvarying affection, until treacherous fortune,
which unexpectedly and out of season assails those who enjoy
auspicious fortune and success, shattered the tranquillity of this
commendable and unwavering friendship. For no man's lack of
guile is so great as always to avoid the poison of envy.

[4.] Someone with a malicious tongue, envying such solid friend-
ship, denounced Pythias as guilty of a capital crime before the
Syracusan tyrant Dionysius, who was accustomed to condemn those
denounced in whatever manner, but was especially arbitrary in
judging capital crimes. This hasty and savage judge was easily
swayed by the briefest allegations and convicted the falsely accused.
