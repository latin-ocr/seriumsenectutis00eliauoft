an impressive range of disciplines. Part of Elias's account of the legal
status of the marriage contract is based on civil law.⁸⁶ Elias's discussion
of marriage is based on the fundamental accounts in Gratian's Decretum,
the Decretales of Gregory D<, and book 4 of Peter Lombard's Sentences.
Here, as in the case of his Aristotelian sources, the difficulty of locating
exact written sources may well indicate that Elias wrote from memory,
relying on knowledge gained from university study or other contact with
civil and canon lawyers.⁸⁷

The most certain sources for Elias's proofs of God's oneness are the
Ambrosiaster's comments on Romans 1.19, as cited by Peter Lombard in
the first book of the Sentences, and Anselrn's Proslogion. The former he
follows with enough verbal parallels to indicate a written source; the
latter he treats with few parallels, as if from memory rather than the
written page. This brings us to the vexing matter of Elias's Aristotelian
proofs. Elias claims to be following the authentic Aristotle, but in fact I
have not been able to locate one incontrovertible borrowing from any
Latin version of the philosopher now available in the Aristoteles Latinus.
The analogues Ι have located are mostly from Arab Aristotelians, such as
Avicenna, Alfarabi, and Algazel, or their early translators and reworkers,
especially Gundissalinus. Such indirect appropriations of the material
Aristotle covers in his De anima and Metaphysics are typical of the intellec-
tual climate of the early thirteenth century. Among British philosophers
whose works have appeared in print, Elias seems closest to, although
notably less complex than, Robert Kilwardby, who wrote in the second
half of the thirteenth century. Given the mountains of philosophical
works lost or still in manuscript, it is impossible to argue that Elias had
no written source for his material. But his rather vague logic and the
parallels noted above are at least consistent with the theory that he
studied philosophy as an arts student at Cambridge, or perhaps else-
where, in the late 1230s or 1240s.⁸⁸ This is quite early in the history of
