238 COMMENTARY

371 Inmortalitatis: Elias substitutes the Latin equivalent for Athanasia; cf.
Remigius (173.18) in Martianum 2134 (42.2): “HUIC ATHANASIAE NOMEN
FUIT. Athanasia Grece, Latine immortalitatem sonat.''

377-79 Reuera . . . intrinsecam: For help with the proper sense and construction
of this passage, see 4.394-401. There, Elias first states what he anticipates will be
Philip's objections, with the main verb in the imperfect subjunctive (causari
presumeres) as throughout this book. Then Elias suggests, as an unreal past
condition, how Philip's judgment would have been improved by considering the
authoi‘s underlying intention; the verbs of both protasis and apodosis are
pluperfect subjunctive. Most likely, 4.377-85, which is one sentence in Texerii's
copy, should be three. Elias would then first rebuke Philip's infatuation. Then, in
a conditional clause which has lost its apodosis, he would explain how Philip
could do better. Finally, he would explain the proper sense of the passage in

the imperfect subjunctive esses, which Elias nowhere uses, so as to avoid hiatus.

380 racionis amor uel sapiencie: Isidore, Etymologiae 2.24.3: ‘'Ipsud autem
nomen [philosophiae] Latine interpretatum amorem sapientiae profitetur.'‘ Cf.
Remigius 66.20 on Philology as '‘amor vel studium rationis¹¹ (repeated by
Mythographus Tertius, 9.1 [1 .213.40]), and John of Salisbury's account of the three
sisters Philology, Philosophy and Philocaly, Metalogicon 4.29 (196.7-15).

385-86 purgacio . .. consecracio: Cf. Remigius (177.13-15) in Martianum 2140
(43.9-13): '‘APOTHEOSIS deificatio vel consecratio interpretatur. Quae bene
mater est Athanasiae quia purgatio mater est immortalitatis.''

403-14 Elias's exegesis of this whole passage depends heavily on Remigius ad
loc. 178.26-179.24 .

4(29-35 The general sense here is clear enough: Elias expects Philip to object to
the notion that eternal life can be achieved through death, so he forestalls the
objection by arguing that remedies (one thinks of modern vaccines) often use the
ailment they are meant to cure to achieve their effect. But the passage seems
unusually corrupt, and my piecemeal emendation may obscure larger lacunae.

454-55 cornei . . . ingenii: Cf. 2.28-29 and note above.

460 Construe eorum with confederacionem (463) rather than examine (460).
