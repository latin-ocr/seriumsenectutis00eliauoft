246 COMMENTARY

1240 which belonged to Richard of Fournival. For the existential thrust of Avi-
cenna's proof, see Michael E. Marmura, “Avicenna's Proof from Contigency,''

134-39 Aristotle, Metaphysics 1035b14-21, 1036a14-25: the parts of the soul are
prior to the concrete animal. Algazel Metaphysica 1.1.5 (37.8-9): ”Quod autem pars
sit prior suo toto in tempore manifestum est.''

139-41 Above, 11.106ff.

146-60 Algazel discusses human sels-knowledge in the context of divine
sels-knowledge at Metaphysica 1.3.2 (64.9-20). For a contemporary proof which
ascends to an eternal creator by way of cognition, see Kilwardby, De ortu scienti-
arum, chap. 26, esp. 82.24-28.

161-74 Anselm, Proslogion 2-3 (ed. Schmitt, 1.101.1-103.11). Elias states An·
selm's central proposition but seems singularly incapable of developing it into a
logical proof. Clearly, Elias approaches philosophy as a writer and grammarian,

not a logician.
177-85 Cf. Metaphysics 1072b10-13.

193-215 Cf. 11.74-83 above. For similar disclaimers by other compilatores, see
the many references assembled by Minnis, 'Ilieory ofAuthorship, 191-99, and for
the compile1‘s own contribution to such works, Theory os Authorship, 200. An
important discussion not mentioned by Minnis but known to Elias is John of
Salisbury, Policraticus 1, prologue (1.16.4-17.20).

230-34 vt eciam . . . destinatus: Since Texerii treats this clause as a separate
sentence, it may be that the main clause upon which it depends has fallen out of
the text. But Elias surely did not mean it to describe the fate of one who asserts
the immortality of the human soul (anime humane . . . assertor, 234-35) as it
does in the manuscript. Better to read it as a result cause following from ni . . .
preelegeris (229-30) and developing the fate of one so foolish as to deny the soul's
immortality.
