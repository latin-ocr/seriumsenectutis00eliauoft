BOOK TEN 191

reverently confirmed these arguments for the immortality of the
soul, so that the difference between the immortal souls of men and
those of beasts, which will die with the body, might remain firm
and undoubted, and likewise, so that those who are distinguished
from brute animals in life by a rational soul might be distinguished
in death by reason‘s immortality.

[14.] Now, setting aside the important life essence of souls or
man's immortality, let us approach the assertions of the pagans, if
you please, and the proofs of the ancients, not because Ῑ believe that
we should uncritically put our faith in their serious or tendentious
statements, or because 1 always value those statements without
question like the stories 1 have just told, but (so to speak) as truths
subject to approval in light of their seeming acceptability, especially
those confirmed by the perusal of so many men of times past in
venerable Antiquity.

fighting alongside his fellow soldiers but was found revivified some
days later among the soldiers killed with him.

[16] There are many other plausible fictions of the poets, or
important assertions or inventions of Antiquity (which is always to
be revered greatly), which at least superficially prove the continued

ridiculously unlearned are familiar with that old poetic figment
about the fierce gigantomachia, in which Bacchus, the lowly son of
mighty Jove, was torn limb from limb while his father Jove cried
out “Euhe.'' Having been utterly ripped to pieces by the powerful
giants, Bacchus was assembled piecemeal in a fatal winnowing-
basket and discovered alive and whole the next day. Anyone who
cares to examine the hidden truth of Bacchus's death should will-
