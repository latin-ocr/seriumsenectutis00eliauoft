BOOK THREE 91

set out with a courageous resolve to die. He also gave his soldiers
a meal before they entered battle, as if they were to dine next in the
otherworld or nowhere. Then they all rushed with one spirit to the
tent housing the headquarters of the Persian king, meaning to fall
with him if they fought auspiciously or at least near his dwelling if
they met with less success. A harsh tumult arose suddenly throughâ€”
out the camp. But the Spartans, frustrated of their hope by their
inability to find the Persian king, roamed victoriously through the
entire camp, manfully slaying the camp's occupants and laying low
everything in their path, like those who know they are attacking so

penalty for sacrilege, the entire force was obliterated by lightning
and torrents of rain. It poured with such a vengeance that, had he
not been hopelessly obtuse, the king might have understood from
the fatal attempt how nonexistent, as even Antiquity admits, is
earthbound man's power to contend with the immortal gods.

[17.] However, as deluded Antiquity divined, Apollo did not
restrict his vengeance to the storm alone. With the Apollonian
godhead procuring an outcome unfavorable to Xerxes in advance,
and with Xerxes's faintheartedness and ridiculously unspirited
inertia furthering the god's purpose, Xerxes soon fought an ill-
