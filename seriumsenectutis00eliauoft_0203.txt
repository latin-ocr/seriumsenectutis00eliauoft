son.'' And he uttered this prayer to his God: â€œLet the soul of this
child, I beseech thee Lord, return into his body.''

[8.] The boy revived immediately, as he had asked, and according
to the learned became the prophet Jonah, so that having been made
more worthy than the worthy, he might worthily be revived later
by the most Worthy. Thus it seems possible to draw an effective
proof of the soul's immortality from the suppliant's own words,
