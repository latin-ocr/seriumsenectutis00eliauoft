BOOK THREE 231

zaff. John of Salisbury devotes a chapter of the Policraticus, 821 (2.379-96), to
the subject of divine vengeance on tyrants, with a long account of Julian the
Apostate as its centerpiece.

29-54 Ovid, Metamorphoses (ed. Anderson) 2.680ff.

30 lippis . . . cecucientibus: See note to 3.85 below and introduction, 28.

33 Maiugena is Mercury's frequent appellation in Martianus Capella; see the
index to Willis's edition, s.v.

39 presagum: Presagatorem would better parallel prenosicicatorem in the previous
member.

45 poronati: See the note to 7.41 below.

82-97 Ovid, Metamorphoses 3.511-731.

8³ For the form *Tioneus (Tionei Tioneo), we can assume that Elias was
misled by MS corruption in a passage such as Isidore of Seville, Etymologiae
8.11.44 (ed. Lindsay): “Iste [Liber] et Graece Διόνυσος a monte Indiae Nysa, ubi
dicitur esse nutritus.¹'

85 nec lippos latet, luscosue nec tonsores: by adding those blind in one eye (lusci),
Elias overgoes Horace's account of Persius's vengeance on the outlaw Rupilius
Rex, “omnibus et lippis notum et tonsoribus'' (Sermones [ed. Garrod] 1.7.3).

89-90 Pentheum . . . pertinacissimum: According to Ovid (Metamorphoses 3514),
Pentheus was “contemptor superum.''

90-91 genialis Bachus: For Elias's phrasing here, and the epithet Leneus in
line 88 above, see Ovid, Metamorphoses 4.11-14.

91 macescens: Cf. Ovid, Metamorphoses 3.6o7, where the kidnapped Bacchus is
described as a boy with girlish figure (“virginea puerum ducit per litora forma'').

98-151 Justinus, Epitoma historiarum Philippicarum 39.1.4ff. (ed. Seel, 269.10ff.).

117-22 According to Justinus 29.1.9 (270.1-4), Grypos (Antiochus, son of
Demetrius Nicanor) had already been established as figurehead king by his
mother after his father's death. Either Elias misread Justinus's statement that
Ptolemy “mittit igitur ingentia Grypo auxilia'' (2923 [270.10-111), or his manu-
script οἱ Justinus was corrupt.

126 consensu communi: cf. 3.636 and 7.64 below. Elias also employs this
phrase in his De vita scolarium, where he concludes a passage associating various
virtuous pagans with the countryside (rus) rather than city by writing: “et, vt
collectiue loquamur ad summam, suas reuera in rure sedes quasi consensu
consederam communi omnes iam pridem posuere virtutes'' (British Library, MS
Arundel 11, fol. 175'). We may either construe the phrase as hypallage ('‘allied
common consent'' for ¹¹[men] allied by common consent''), or take (pre-)conjedera to
in the loose sense of “agreed upon.'' The use of consederate at 1375 corroborates
the latter interpretation.

129-31 Sed . . . inedia: The basic sense is clear from lustinus‘s account at 2925
(27o.18-20): “Ibi inops pecuniae, cum stipendia militibus dessent, in templo Iovis
solidum ex auro signum Victoriae tolli iubet.¹‘ Construe: Sed ibi efflectus inops
pecunie sibi minus tempestiue, [etl male molestatus inedia, cum [Allexanderl moraretur
debita de more stipendia castrorum, etc. (‘'But now having become destitute of the
money no longer easily available to him, and sorely afflicted by hunger, when
Alexander withheld the payments due by custom to his troops,'' etc.)

134 [vlasreciis: Cf. vasrecias (12.69). The classical form is vafritia.

1³4-35 tyranni . . . Syracusani: The Syracusan tyrant was, of course, Dionysius
the Elder, who ruled from 405 to 367 BC. Cf. 13.79-113 below.

139-47 Paucis . . . interfectus: Texerii begins a new sentence at denique (146), but
continuing the same sentence provides a finite verb for what precedes. lt may be
