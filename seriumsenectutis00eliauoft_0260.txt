244 COMMENTARY

127 proptergcultus edicularum: Cf. Petronius, Satyrica 85.1 (ed. Miiller and Ehlers,

171-84 4 Rg. 13.20-21.

199-209 Macrobius, Commen tarii 1 .1.9 (3.16-24): “Sed ille Platonicus secretorum
relator Er quidam nomine fuit, natione Pamphylus. . . .'' It is easy to see that
Elias's mistaken notion that Er and “Pamphilus'' were two different people has
its germ in this passage, but it is hard to see how he could have made the
mistake by misreading only these lines.

213-19 Cf. Servius, in Georgica 1.166 (ed. Thilo-Hagen, 3.1.171.1o-14): “ET
MYSTICA VANNVS IACCHI. . . . hinc est quod dicitur Osiridis membra a
Typhone dilaniati Isis cribro superposuisse: nam idem est Liber pater . . . quem
Orpheus a gigantibus dicit esse discerptum.” This account is repeated by the
Second Vatican Mythographer, chap. 114 (ed. Kulcsar, 184); chap. 92 (ed. Bode,
1.106.26-32). Cf. Mythographus Tertius, 125 (ed. Bode, 1.246.5-8): ‘'habet fabula,
Gigantes Bacchum inebriatum invenisse, et discerpto eo per membra, frustra
sepelisse, et eum paulo post vivum et integrum resurrexisse.''

230-36 Asclepius 37 (347.20-348.3); De civitate Dei 826 (1.364.20-26). This
sentence likewise lacks a finite verb in its source.

239-50 Ad Lucilium epistolae morales 86.1 (ed. Reynolds, 1.297-98).

249 deesse: Although Reynolds prints esse in his edition of Seneca, he records
deesse as a variant in his class δ - BN latinus 8658A and 8539.

266-70 Jo. 11.

281-91 Mt. 9.18-26.

295-311 Lc. 7.11-17.

Book Eleven

14 Tale . . . subsidere: Construing the infinitive subsidere as the object of Solari
(15) is a desperate remedy, but otherwise it is hard to preserve either the sense or
the meter of the line.

32-35 Fere . . . viuentes: Cf. Milton, Paradise Lost 9.41-46, and the preface to book
2 of The Reason of Omrch Government (ed. Haug, p. 814).

86-91 Ambrosiaster on Romans 1.19 (CSEL 81 .88) apud Peter Lombard, Senten-
tiae 1.3.1.2 (ed. Brady, 1.69.10-14).

106 Quicquid . . . aut accidens est aut substancia: The Old Logic provided ample
precedent for dividing all that is into substance and accident: cf. Aristotle's
Categories 1a20-1b10, 1b25-2a4, 2a34-2b6, Isidore, Etymologiae 2.26.1o-11, as well
as Boethius, De trinitate, 4, where Boethius discusses God in terms of the Aristote-
lian categories and concludes that while normal predications are called accidentia
secundum rem, predications made of God are named secundum substantiam rei
praedicatio (ed. and trans. Stewart et al., pp. 24-25). I am grateful to Professor
Eleonore Stump for these references.

For a metaphysical rather than epistemological framework more in keeping with
Elias's treatment here (¹¹sumatur ethic accidens habundancius quam sumi consue-
uit m logica¹¹ [108-91), see: Physics 242a50-243a31, 256a4-21, 256b21-25, 258b10-11,
259a14-15, Metaphysics 1007a21-b18 (cf. Avicenna, Liber de philosophia prima, 2.1 [ed.
van Riet,1..65 13-66. 231), Metaphysics 1034a31,1034b16-18,1045b28-29,1072b10-12,
1072b26-31. However, perusal of these passages in either the old or new Latin ver-
sions printed m Aristoteles Latinus will convince any reader that, despite his claim
to use the real Aristotle, Elias did not follow any of these passages directly.
