GRAVE THOUGHTS IN OLD AGE

The scholar who alters the sacred union of man and wife
Often fails to achieve a joyful union
And loquaciously betrays the mysteries of gods and mem
A bond to be honored in marriage to the limits of faith
Unites Juno with Jove, the lame craftsman
With the Cyprian, couples Abderite and Coan,
Joins Argiona to Janus, while striving

Behaving hostilely, his wife puts a foul union to the test,
Nor, joined to him by contract, will she wish
To strengthen his life so he flourishes on earth.
