BOOKS NINE AND TEN 243

dvitate Dei, but the verbal parallel here should clinch the case that Elias worked
from Augustine as well as the Asclepius.

66-69 Ex. 32.

85-89 3 Rg. 12.28-30.

90-97 3 Rg. 11.1-8.

109-10 fimbrias . . . dilatauit: Cf. Mt. 235.

113-20 Ovid, Metamorphoses 15.626-744.

114 Mercurius: Elias's confusion of Mercury and Aesculapius here may have its
root in a misreading of Augustine's account of the Asclepius (De civitate Dei 826
[1365.3-7]): “Ecce duos deos dicit homines fuisse, Aesculapium et Mercurium.
Sed de Aesculapio et Graeci et Latini hoc idem sentiunt} Mercurium autem multi
non putant fuisse mortalem, quem tamen iste avum suum fuisse testatur?

121-31 Elias could have found accounts of Apis in the First Vatican Mythog-
113ῖῖ11ιὲῗῖ (2728Κξ41ῗίῗὲκ1>ῗιῐῖιὶιεθέιῇῗεῗῑιῖἑαςὲπωῖξεξηῗαξῖιῖῗζὲῗξ-ἒῗίἒὲὴξᾶίῐέῗῃὲξῗι,
158.17-159. 21), Pliny, Natural History 8.184-85 (ed. and trans. Rackham, 3.128-29),
Isidore, Etymologiae 8.11.85-86, and Vincent of Beauvais, Speculum doctrinale 17.10
(1556C). Tlte first two offer the most verbal parallels, but none provides a source
for Apis's apotheosis (in aere leuabatur). The image of Apis appearing from a
stream also does not appear in these authorities but might arise from a medieval
reinterpretation (of the type studied by Panofsky in Renaissance and Renascences in
Western Art, 87-100, albeit not informed by any christianizing tendency) of the
killing of the bull representing Apis in a sacred well, as described by the First
Mythographer, Solinus, and Pliny.

Book Ten

lsff. Elias begins his reply to Philip's twin claims that the human soul is not
immortal and that there is not one omnipotent God.

42-50 For syzygies, see Remigius (67.26-68.10) in Marcianum 1.1 (1.7). For a
different discussion of the mean uniting body and soul, see Vincent of Beauvais,
Speculum naturale 23.44-48 (1682Eff.).

56 For Genius as god of generation, see Remigius (118.8-10) in Martian um 1.49
(18.17): ‘'GENIUS deus naturalis qui omnium rerum generationibus praeest.
Genios enim dicimus qui singulis nascentibus tribuuntur-'¹ (repeated with attribu-
tion by the Third Mythographer, 1.185.1-5). Remigius also treats Genius as a
moral voice or type of conscience (11931-32), and as a tutelary spirit (184.4-14,
in Martianum 2.152 [46.14-20]).

67-72 Sic Israeliticis: Texerii copied this sentence without a main verb,
which 1 have supplied by deleting quo before progredi (67) and construing the
subjunctive pergamus (67) as potential. However, as quo progredi pergamus is one
of Elias's favorite formulae for introducing purpose clauses, my sense is that a
main clause has fallen out of the sentence after the two purpose clauses (quo . . .
pergamus, ut . . . procuremus). Note also the gap in the sense between this sentence
and that which follows.

77-118 3 Rg. 17.

112 Ionas . . . propheta: The notion that the boy revivified by Elijah became the
prophet Jonah derives from Jerome‘s Prologue to Jonah: ”Sanctum ionam hebrei
affirmant filium fuisse mulieris vidue sareptane quem helias propheta mortuum
suscitauit, matre postea dicente ad eum: Nunc cognoui quia vir dei es tu, et
verbum dei in ore tuo est veritas'' (Biblia cum glossa, 4935‘).
