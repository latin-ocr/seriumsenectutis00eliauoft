BOOK THREE 97

since the harsh decrees of the most ferocious tyrants or fictitious
divinities are frequently mitigated by supplication and effaced by
voluntary confession, the Crotonians humbly sought an oracle from
the sanctuary at Delphi. According to the writers of fable, Apollo
responded that they could put an end to the evil by placating
Minerva's violated godhead and the spirits of those they had

the despoilers' hands makes it clear that the garment was dearer
than it should have been to Phoebus, inasmuch as he did not need
it or any other clothing to preserve him from a chill.

savage vengeance. When Antony's prefect Turullius cut down most
