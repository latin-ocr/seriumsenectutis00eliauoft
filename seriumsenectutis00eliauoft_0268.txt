rediuiuus and the three works which survive only in fragments do not show the
acquaintance with academie philosophy and the new Aristotle, in however
mediated a form, which has caused us to date the Serium senectutis as late as
possible in Elias's career.¹⁵

Besides its understandable lack of an attribution to Elias or any other author, the
Petronius rediuiuus does differ significantly from the Serium senectutis and the frag-
mentary works in at least two aspects, First, although the Petronius rediuiuus dooe
use Suetonius as a source for its account of the death of Nero in piece 3, the bulk
of its anecdotal material is medieval (for example, piece 5 on Robert Guiscard and
his daughter) or even contemporary with the author (pieces 1 and 4). 'Il-nere is
ample precedent for such anecdotes in Walter Map's De nugis curialium and John of
Salisbury's Policraticus.¹⁶ And we find similar anecdotes in the tabula to the De vita
scolarium, s.v. Arthurus, where Arthur is treated as a just king,¹⁷ and in the tale
from the Contra nobilitatem, repeated at some length by Ringstede, of a British
knight in Norway.¹⁸ But all the other exempla in the two fragmentary works come
from Roman literature and history, especially Valerius Maximus.¹⁹ And it is Valeri-
us and Justinus who supply virtually all the exemplary material for the Serium
senectutis. Second, the Petronius rediuiuus displays an interest in businessmen and
their need to deceive their customers in order to sell their goods which doae not
recur in the Serium senectutis and the other works attributed to Elias.²⁰

Are there any borrowings from Petronius in the Serium senectutis and the lost
works to match those in the Petronius rediuiuus? The only resemblance between
the Serium senectutis and the Satyrica is merely verbal. Propter cultus edicularum
(ediculorum S {10.127]) seems a fairly clear echo of propter cultum edicularum
(Satyrica 851). ¹ But Whethamstede's entry for magister in his tabula to the De
vita scolarium reveals a more substantial indebtedness to Petronius. According to

Whethamstede, the opening prose of the De vita scolarium argued the following:

nil legunt discipulis nilve dicunt nisi quod ipsi commendant ymmo vt
adulacionibus placeant. Ad instar vilium viuunt parasitorum qui dum suis
friuolis ad mensam diuitis procurant ingressum, eas solummodo vt hillariter
excipiantur prolaturi sunt nugulas que placent (British Library, MS Arun del
11, fol. 174‘).

Inter ruricolas eciam viget prudencia Dedali, industria Tritoloni, Vlixis paciencia, Scipionis
moderancia, Enee pietas, Herculis virilitas, sobrietas Romuli, fidelitasque Pompei'' (MS
Arundel 11, fol. 175¹).

¹⁹ For example, the anecdotes concerning Calpurnius Piso, Pyrrhus of Epirus, and
Mucius Scaevola recounted by Ringstede, In proverbia Solomonis, lectiones 121 and 131
(Lincoln College, MS latin 86, fols. 194Vb, 207Vb-208'¹). These anecdotes come, respectively,
from Valen'us Maximus, Facta et dicta memorabilia, 4.3.1o, 7.3.14, and 4.1.11.
