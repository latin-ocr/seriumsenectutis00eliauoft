descended from heaven! directing his speech to her in the name of
her groom: “Your husband, I shall marry you to myself in my truth
and justice.''

[9.] That sensible soliloquizer and theologica] philosopher the
Psalmist reveals how hasty you are in your rude and histrionic
censure of perfectly acceptable statements. Speaking of those who
boast of their evil, he says in the midst of a serious discourse
strengthened by sensible silence: “All the day long thy tongue hath
devised injustice: as a sharp razor, thou hast wrought deceit.''
Another time, speaking sensibly and without boasting, this same
man says: “My tongue shall meditate justice all the day.'' Nor does

about or murmur against, unaware that the soberly sensible and
laudably literate loosen the reins of free speech when they utter
such frequent metaphors, using language to conjoin things not
harmonious by nature. Those who are accustomed to speaking
freely in metaphor implicitly leave something that can or even must
be understood beneath the verbal surface. So 1 will in some measure
satisfy you and, what is morel your obstinate effrontery if you care
to perk up your ferocious little ears and listen.

[11.] The spiritual soliloquizer says: “All the day long thy tongue
hath devised injustice.'' He seems! quite discordantly' to attribute
the power of thought to the tongue; however, what he leaves us to
understand absolves the expression from fault. He leaves us to
understand that this statement vituperates the mental vacuity or
