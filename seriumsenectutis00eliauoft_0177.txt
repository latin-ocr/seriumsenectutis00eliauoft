BOOK SEVEN 161

[5.] Many other examples of lies duly punished will occur even
to those who seek only halfheartedly in the most obvious places.
But for our present purpose it will suffice to give but one example,
which is to be heard on any street corner or in any brothel, of the
punishment for lying. The power of divine virtue punished in the
end the abominable crime of the Babylonian priests who, spurred
on by wantonness, burned for Susanna, the righteous wife of Ioa-

chim—a woman as chaste as she was beautiful, who feared her God
with the sober firmness of love. The story is, I unagine, well known
even to barbers and the bleary eyed. Furthermore, to indulge
ourselves briefly with matters made famous by true Antiquity, one
day, when Susanna was relaxing according to her custom by stroll-
ing alone (as she thought) in her orchard during the midday heat,
these priests and judgeS, grown old in evil days and reduced to
utter foolishness by their lust, leapt from the hiding place in which
they had concealed themselves, for lust will indulge its impulses
and wantonness exert its force. At first they begged her meekly to
entertain their swelling lust, but when they realized that it would
be impossible to prevail upon her resolute chastity, they proceeded
to accuse her unjustly, claiming repeatedly that they had seen her
commit adultery with her lover. Thus, contrary to right and justice,
they would perform the office of both witnesses and prosecutors,
not to mention judges.

[6.] But God—most just of the just and a judge impossible to
circumvent, always on high and dwelling in eternity, supreme
artificer, unconstrained master, unfailing administrator and ever-
vigilant minister of the universe— provided for the unjustly accused
by rousing the spiritual power of foresight in Daniel and enriching
the youth's intelligence with subtlety sufficient to free the innocent
victim, for the youth proved the priests guilty by trying them
separately. So in the end they rightly endured the fatal punishment
for their falsehoods: after they had condemned themselves by their
own lies, they were forced by public stoning to quit this sublunar
realm, to die forever unfortunate in unending infamy, or rather to
live eternally to their own harm in perpetual punishment.
