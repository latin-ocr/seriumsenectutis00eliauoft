BALEUS AND FLACIUS 15

account of Elias dispensing moral wisdom to self-important nobility, we
should not be any swifter to take it as fact.

4. Baleus and Placius

In their accounts of Elias, all the English antiquaries are sons of
Bale. It is appropriate then that the other branch of Elias studies which
established itself among Reformers in Germany was founded by Bale's
kindred spirit on the Continent, Matthias Flacius Illyricus.⁶⁶ Schmidt has
pointed out that the second edition of Flacius's Catalogus testium ueritatis
includes a chapter Helias Rubeus Tripelauensis which summarizes and
quotes from the lost Semidiales, or “Half Holies,'' of our author.⁶⁷ From
there he enters the Lectiones memorabiles of Iohannes Wolfius, where he
figures in the entry for 1264 as a critic of ecclesiastical abuses. Flacius
does not say how the Semidiales came to his attention, but when he
mentions Baleus in suo scriptorum catalogo, we may reasonably suspect that

Bale himself was involved.

From the length at which Flacius excerpts and quotes Elias it seems
likely that he had a manuscript of the Semidiales at hand as he wrote. In
that sense he knows far more about Elias than Bale had when the first

nine centuries of the Catalogus were published five years earlier in 1557.
He even knows Elias can be prolix.⁶⁸ But what he says about Elias the
man is easily reconciled with what Bale had said:

About three hundred years ago a certain Elias, Rubeus Tripelaniensis
by surname, an Englishman 1 believe, wrote Semidiales in seven
books. . . . Although this writer has not been printed we attribute

after index and errata. This edition also includes an Appendix with its own collation AA⁶-
EE⁶ and separate pagination 1-58 plus one ssyleaf. This appendix contains material,
delivered at the last moment, as the introductory Lectori Typographus explains, from Alain
Chartier and Froissart, among others, but nothing from Elias. lt is in a different type than
the main volume—clearer, more widely spaced, thinner, and larger—and ends with the
colophon: “Basiliae, Ex officina Ioannis Oporini, anno salutis humanae MDLXll. Mense
Martio.'¹
