240 COMMENTARY

65-69 Cf. Gaius, Institutes 2.193-96 (ed. de Zulueta, 1.120-22); Iustinian,
Institutiones 2.20.8, 31 (ed. Krueger, 123, 25).

75 The standard medieval account of Hymenaeus was provided by Servius, in
Aeneida 1.651 (Harvard ed. 1.276-77) and, more fully, 499 (Harvard ed„ 2.286-87);
it was repeated by all three Vatican mythographers: 1.74 (ed. Kulcsar 33), 2263
(287-88);1.75 (ed. Bode, 1.26.17-35), 2219 (1 .148.9-36), and 3.11.3 (1.229.3-230.12).
According to this euhemeristic account, Hymenaeus was a young Athenian of
humble origins who won his noble beloved by rescuing her and the maidens who
accompanied her from pirates who abducted them on their way to the Eleusinian
mysteries.

77 Genius figures below at 1056 as the progenitor of each human soul; see
Horace, Epistulae 2.2.187-89 and Nitzsche, The Genius figure, 15-20. However, it
was customary to consider Hymenaeus, if not a mortal Athenian, the son of
Venus and Bacchus (Servius, in Aeneida 4.127 [Harvard ed. 2294] and Mythog-
raphus Tertius 112 [1.229.35-37]). Hymenaeus is the husband of Venus and father
of Cupid in Alan of Lille's De planctu Nature, where he delivers Nature's sum-
mons to Genius. In lieu of any source naming Genius as the father of Hymenaeus,
we may speculate that Elias has conflated confused memories of Servius and
Alan.

79 Hermaphroditus was the son of Venus and Mercury: Ovid, Metamorphoses
4.285-308. While the general sense of this passage is clear enough—Elias refuses
to be carried away by his own fictions—it is not easy to make sense of in detail.
The hedonistic mother of Hermaphroditus is Venus, the mother of Hymen (see
the note to 6.75): does Elias mean to refer twice in different terms to Venus for
the sake of emphasis, or should we emend the ultimate clause to refer to Her-
maphroditus's father, Mercury? The latter might be thought to shatter Elias's
controlling fiction of Mercury as god of eloquence, but by twice offering accounts
critical of Mercury's deception by Battus and subsequent revenge Elias shows that
he is neither blind to Mercury's faults nor unaware of the limits of fictions.

90-93 Remocius . . . sonitus: Elias's renunciation of the Muses draws its inspira-
tion from the scene in which Philosophy banishes them from the sickbed of
Boethius at the beginning of the Consolation, 1 pr. 1 (ed. Bieler, 2.23-3.3); for
verbal parallels, see Martianus 2.117 and 127 (33.16-19 and 4020).
