ing defended God's word, Elias turns to pagan literature in the person of
Martianus Capella. Using the standard commentary by Remigius of
Auxerre, he allegorizes four passages: Hymen's binding of the elements
in the opening hymn (16-17), Mercury's scanty garments (18-19), the
caduceus (20-21), and Philology's offering to Athanasia and Apotheosis
(22-25). He concludes by suggesting that the next time Philip is tempted
to mock something, he should put his finger over his lips (26-28).

Book Five:

After a meter on the dangers of a slippery tongue (i), Philip
promises to hold his peace (1-2).

Book Six:

In the opening meter, Philip reiterates his promise to remain
silent (i). Elias, in turn! makes a concession to his advanced age by prom-
ising to forego his marriage allegory and fancy words (1). In something
of an aside, he argues from canon law that the absence of a dowry does
not invalidate a legitimate marriage (2-4). He will consider the marriage
of mind and tongue without any reference to Hymen, Genius] Juno
pronuba, or the Muses (5-6).

Book Seven:

The meter argues that since old age is hateful in the marriage bed
it should concern itself with virtue (i). Elias continues the marriage
discussion by arguing that marriages are legitimized by affection not
documents (1). He then repeats Philip's point that, although not every-
thing said by the ancients is true, they do often provide useful examples
of honest behavior (2). He repeats the stories of Mercury and Battus (3)
and the explorers of the Promised Land (4), and adds the story of Su-
sanna and the elders (5-6). He concludes with a warning that a lying
mouth slays the soul (7).

Book Eight:

ΤΙιε meter reiterates Elias's point about the danger a lying mouth
poses to the soul (i). Philip revives and advances rather surprising claims
that man is not the only animal blessed with an immortal soul, and that
God is not alone in possessing absolute power (1). He argues the first
point by noting that pagan philosphers disagree as to the composition of
the human soul (2-3) while agreeing on its immortality (4). While men
are more intelligent than other creatures (5), their nakedness leaves them
more vulnerable than other animals (6). Man's excellence arises from the
