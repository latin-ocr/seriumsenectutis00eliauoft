Metamorphoses. But their greatest stock of exempla is drawn from Justi-
nus's epitome of Pompeius Trogus's Philippic Histories and Valerius Maxi-
mus's Facta et dicta memorabilia. Valerius must have been one of the
authors Elias modeled himself upon, since he cites him with a minimum
of verbal alterations or additions. The less convoluted Justinus does not
fare so well: Elias elaborates his syntax and frequently moralizes his
action, seemingly in an attempt to make Justinus read more like Valerius.
Even so, the narratives drawn from the these two authors are among the
most straightforward passages in the Serium senectutis and contrast
strongly with Elias's own syntactically difficult passages of reflection and
transition.

While Ovid is the only literary author whom Elias borrows from at
length, our author does echo brief passages from Vergil, Horace, Persius,
Juvenal, the Apocolocyn tosis attributed to Seneca, and possibly Petronius.
But the Serium senectutis does not contain any clear echoes of the Disticha
Catonis or the other libri Catoniani, which we would expect Elias to have
been familiar with from his teaching duties.⁹⁰ This is perhaps especially
surprising in the case of Maximianus's Elegies, which would seem to
pertain rather directly to Elias's subject matter. But Elias also neglecte a
far greater treatment of old age, Cicero's Cato Maior de senectute. And
while there are enough structural and verbal resemblances to suggest
that Elias knew the two greatest prosimetra of the twelfth-century-
Bernardus Silvestris's Cosmographia and Alan of Lille's De planctu Natu-
rae—there are no direct borrowings from either in the Serium senectutis.
We can, Ι think, best make sense of this patchwork of literary borrowings
and omissions by viewing Elias of Thriplow as a conscious classicizer,
albeit within the limits established by thirteenth-century humanism.

7. Genre

In form, the Serium senectutis is what the Middle Ages would
have labelled a prosimetrum.⁹1 In the terms of modern genre theory, it is
a Menippean satire,⁹² although we must heed Joel Relihan's warning

1:66-79, and M. Boas, “De librorum Catonianorum historia atque compositione,‘¹ Mne-
