BOOK NINE

It always has been and will be quite vain to produce
Empty talk or ring the changes on senseless topics;
Any wise man will want to put vanities well asidel
Since only serious thoughts please a sensible man;
While it pleases a fool to waste all his time
On vanities, a wise man acts wisely.
A weak man will want to live in senseless vices,
And living badly is death to the robust mam
Only the love of virtue trees a man ssourishing
In virtue from vices and makes him spurn vanities;
Thus a man strong in virtue avoids vanity
And banishes it utterly from all his concerns.

[1.] Let us proceed to the second topic: it ought to seem remark-
able to any sensible person that there should be one and only one
God, especially since venerable Antiquity, for which supreme
reverence was long since decreed in perpetuity, established for itself
and devoutly worshipped innumerable multitudes of gods; on the
other hand, not a few of the wisest natural philosophers remained
in legitimate doubt concerning the substances of God or gods. So a
certain natural philosopher Ibn Daud, a man who was once preemi-
nent among the best, could say in earnest: “If God exists' let Him
be; if He does not exist, let me be.'' By speaking conditionally, he
made it clear that he was less than perfectly certain about the
existence of the supreme Deity.

[2.] Antiquity is always to be revered greatly: reverence was and
is legally decreed for it as if by perpetual edict. The ancients strove
to show the highest reverence for their innumerable gods, but they
especially consecrated the secret spiritual prerogative of veneration
to their chosen gods, little caring (as far as I can tell) that an over-
abundant multitude is rarely in the habit of accommodating itself to
virtue. Perhaps they also failed to take heed of how frequently the
parity of numerous joint possessors incites ruinous squabbles.
