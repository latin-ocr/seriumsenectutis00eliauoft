to avoid the logical defect of a permanent regress.

[7.] The same thing can be proved by another argument no less
worthy of approval. Whatever dwells in the totality of mutable
things is either whole or part, or virtual whole or virtual part, or a
property of whole or part. Ῑ do not say “virtual whole'' for no
reason, since not every whole is of the same property, mode, or
class. For anything is either integral or universal. Any body is an
integral whole, constituted from its integral parts. A part of any
body is part of an integral whole. Any spirit is an integral virtual
whole. Any part of a spirit is a part of a virtual whole. Man's
faculties are in fact parts of a virtual whole; however, not the
quantitative but the potential faculties, such as the power of under-
standing or remembering, or other similar faculties. It will be
apparent to any subtle investigator that it is necessary that all these
things receive existence from one source. No law of reason will
allow the whole to exist of itself. For nothing is prior in time be-
cause it exists of itself.

[8.] To continue on the same subject: the disposition of its parts
never emanated from a whole. Indeed, any part is prior by nature
to its whole. Thus no whole can be God, since in that case it were
necessary that something else precede God in existence. Nor is any
part God: any whole is more worthy than a part; thus, no part can
be God. As concerns the nature of whole and part, that they do not
exist of themselves can be proven by the argument that was previ-
ously applied to accidents. Absolutely not one of the above can
determine its own substance, as has already been shown with
sufficient clarity (it would, indeed, be utterly impossible), but rather
something else, from which all other things derive, which exists in
eternity. That is the sole supreme God.

[9.] To continue, since a sound mind cannot ignore itself, man
cannot fail to be aware that he came into being at some point.
Likewise, he should be aware, as regards himself, that since he does
not exist separately, he could not maintain his own existence. Thus
he was allotted existence by another. But it is manifest that this
other did not come into being, since if it took its existence from
another there would be no first creator of all things which exist.
And if it took its being from another which itself could not give a
beginning to its essence unless it existed from eternity, it would be
necessary to ascend further back to another from which it received
its subsistence. It is necessary that this being exist from eternity and
