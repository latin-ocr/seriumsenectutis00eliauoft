GENRE 27

that this label is modern rather than classical.⁹³ Its central conceit, style,
and contents, as well as form, all betray the fact that Elias has written a
work which is not only modeled on classical and medieval exemplars,
but seeks to convey meanings in ways similar to those employed by the
earlier works. The Serium senectutis belongs to the subgenre of Menip-
pean dialogue, of which the outstanding Latin exemplar is Boethius's

consolation os Philosophy.⁹⁴ It also betrays the modal influence of moral-
ized histories such as Valerius Maximus's Facta et dicta memorabilia or
John of Salisbury' s Policraticus in Philip's discussion of divine vengeance
on human impiety,⁹⁵ and of scholastic philosophy in Elias's proofs for
God's unique omnipotence.

How does recognizing the Serium senectutis as a Menippean satire
contribute to our understanding of the work itself? For as Fowler re-
minds us: ‘'genres have to do with identifying and communicating rather

than with defining and classifying. We identify the genre to interpret the
exemplar.''⁹⁶ In the first instance we should not overlook the practical
importance of identifying genre correctly. The Serium senectutis lay
unknown to literary scholars before Schmidt because Scott's index to the
Sloane collection mistakenly registered it as a “Sermon on Old Age.''⁹⁷
More importantly, recognizing generic affiliation and inssuences allows
us to discover the form and meaning of what must otherwise seem a
rather formless and enigmatic work. As we have seen, Beryl Smalley

internal and external characteristics5 subgenres, which add further specifications to those of
genre; and modes, which retain the internal repertoire· of kinds while shedding their

a “Sermo de senectute“ goes back, by way of Sir Hans Sloane's own catalogue, to the
earlier catalogue of Edward Bernard. See below, 42-43.
