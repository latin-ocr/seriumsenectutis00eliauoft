44 INTRODUCTION

prized acquisition, a copy of Nennius.¹⁴³ And enough of the Prise
manuscripts which did not find a home at Hereford Cathedral or Jesus
College, oxford have entered the Cotton collection for us to suspect that
the manuscript which contains the Serium senectutis may have entered
Bernard's collection by a similar route.¹⁴⁴ But having said that much,
we must acknowledge that Prise mentions neither Elias of Triplow nor
the other contents of Sloane 441 in his Historiae Brytannicae defensio.¹⁴⁵
Furthermore, Prise collected works of history and theology. If he did
acquire the manuscript which became Sloane 441, he would have done so
because of an interest in the Pseudo-Dionysius and not Elias of Thriplow
or Fulgentius. As a final caveat, we should note that N. R. l<er personally
inspected Sloane 441 while compiling Medieval Libraries of Great Britain
but nowhere connects the manuscript to Prise, as he undoubtedly would
have done if he had noted any sure signs of provenance.¹⁴¹6

10. This Edition

Sloane 441 was produced caresully, with corrections throughout,
but at some remove from the original. Reading Elias against his sources
suggests that besides Elias's own stylistic ornamentation or substitutions,
numerous corruptions have crept into the text of Sloane 441. In the more
difficult passages there are signs that Texerii or scribes earlier in the
history of transmission have been alternately baffled by and prone to
revise the readings they encountered. Therefore, while I have made every
attempt to justify manuscript readings, I have not hesitated to emend
them when that seemed called for. I cannot be sure that 1 have in every
case recovered the authorial reading, but I have seen no reason to leave
an already difficult work littered with textual absurdities.

Besides providing rubrics for each book of the Serium senectutis, Texerii
also uses rubricated initials to distinguish subsections, primarily biblical
passages and exempla, in books 3 and 10.¹4⁷ Paragraphs and their nu-
