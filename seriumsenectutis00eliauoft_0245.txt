BOOK Two 229

Nevertheless, the source of this theme most important to the Middle Ages was
Martianus‘s mythological treatment in De nuptiis, books 1 and 2, which Elias
would have understood in the allegorical sense expounded by Remigius of
Auxerre in terms borrowed from the De inventione: “Philologia ergo ponitur in
persona sapientie et rationis, Mercurius in similitudine facundiae et sermonis. Ut
autem Cicero dicit, eloquentia, id est sermonis copia, sine ratione et sapientia
nocet aliquando, raro aut numquam prodest,· sapientia vero sine eloquentia
prodest semper, numquam obest. Cum ergo in sapiente haec duo convenerint, et
acumen videlicet rationis et facundia sermonis, tunc quodam modo sociantur
Mercurius et Philologia, tuncque promptissimum est unicuique ad scientiam VII
liberalium artium accedere'' (in Martianum 1.1 [66.22-29]). Rehandlings of Martia-
nus's allegory are extremely widespread (Nuchelmans, ‘'Philologia et son mari-
age,'' 92-107). But besides Remigius's Commentum, which he certainly kneW, the
treatment Elias is most likely to have known is that of John of Salisbury, who
treats the marriage as an allegory of proper education, Metalogicon 429 (ed.
Webb, 195.9ff.) or intellectual maturity, Entheticus de dogmate philosophorum (ed.
van Laarhoven) 167-222. Note also Metalogicon 1.1 (7.13) and Policraticus 2.19 (ed.
Webb, 109.5-7). It is clear from John's account that the marriage served, particu-
larly in the twelfth century, as a rallying point for defenders of humanism.
Notice, however, that Elias both literalizes (or demythologizes) and explicitly
Christianizes the theme in the course of the Serium senectutis.

104-14 Ps. 14. Elias paraphrases the entire psalm.

119-24 Cf. Ps. 5.17; 13.3ff.; 77.36-37.

124-30 Augustine, De mendacio 1.3 (ed. and trans. Combes, pp. 242-45),
repeated by Vincent of Beauvais, Speculum doctrinale 994 (Douay ed„ 833A-B).
Peter Lombard, Sententiae 3.38.3-4 (2.215.6-216.13) covers the same ground more
exhaustively with quotations from Augustine's Contra mendacium and Enchiridion.

131-35 Ps. 33.13-14.

Book Two

21-22 “Antonomasice, id est excellenter,'' John of Salisbury, Metalogicon 2.16
(90.18-19). For antonomasia as rhetorical figure, see Matthew of Vendome, Ars
versificatoria 1.60-61 (ed. Faral, 132) and Geoffrey of Vinsauf, Poetria nova (ed.
Faral) 923-35, 1775-80, 1807-9.

28-29 tam rudis . .. vel adeo cornea: Persius 1.47 (cf. 4.32-33, 454-55 below).

44-50 Cf. Ps. 24.4; 30.6-7 (as well as the references at 1.119-24 above). The
soliloquizer is, of course, David. See Minnis, Medieval Theory of Authorship, 44,
who traces the idea back via the Glossa ordinaria to Augustine's Enarrationes in
psalmos.

48 licentis: Elias seems to substitute licentis for licentie in a desperate attempt to
avoid hiatus.

53 vanos ... stateris: Ps. 61.10.

'77-87 Triuiale . . . redegerit: Expands on Ps. 7.12-13. Consti-ue quod (77) .. . quod
(78) followed by the subjunctive spernat . . . spreuerit . . . redigat . . . redegerit (86-87)
as indirect discourse. For similar constructions, see 2.28-40, 50-60.

82 diouolariter: Paulus Diaconus, Epitome Sexti Pompei Festi De verborum signifi-
catu (ed. Lindsay, 65.8-9): “DIOBOLARES MERETRICES dicuntur, quae duobus
obolis ducuntur.'' TLL also cites examples from Plautus, Varro, and Fulgentius.

85-86 arcusque . . . conuertentes: We might approximate to the meaning of this
phrase by emending to arcumque facile remissibilem in se pravitate sua conuertentes,
