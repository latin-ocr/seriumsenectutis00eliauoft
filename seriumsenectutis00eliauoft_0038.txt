22 INTRODUCTION

shape of the body and head, not the powers of the soul (7), a point which
is confirmed by the ease with which physical injuries impair the work-
ings of intellect or soul (8).

Book Nine:

After a meter urging man to avoid vanity and cultivate virtue (i),
Philip argues his second point from the fact that philosophers are not
sure that there is only one God (1). Antiquity worshipped a multitude of
gods (2); Philip cites the Hermetic Asclepius on man's creation of idols to
worship (3-4). Even the Israelites worshipped the golden calf in the
desert (5) and the two calves at Dan and Bethel (6); Solomon also wor-
shipped a number of gods (7). Rome worshipped the Epidaurian serpent
(8) and the Egyptians worshipped Apis in the form of an ox (9). Philip
ends by daring Elias to refute him (10).

Book Ten:

A meter warns that the man who refuses to coexist with others
is obnoxious to all (i). Elias replies to Philip's dare by asserting that only
reason distinguishes man from the animals and makes him like a god (1).
The immortality of the soul is proved by the fact that a corpse will bleed
in the presence of its slayer (2). All religious sects offer proofs for the
soul's immortality (3). Any resurrection of the dead provides an example
(4). Elias offers three: Elijah resurrected the son of the widow of Sarepta
(5-8); Elisha provided his elderly hosts in Sunam with a son, and revivi-
fied him after an untimely death (9-11); and a dead man was brought
back to life just by touching Elisha's coffin (12). Elias concludes his Old
Testament proofs with a reminder that man is distinguished from the
animals by reason in life and an immortal soul in death (13).

Elias then offers some pagan proofs for the immortality of the soul:
Plato's vision of Er (15), the restoration of Bacchus after he was torn to
pieces by the giants (16), the Asclepius on man's return to the stars aster
death (17), and Seneca on Scipio Africanus's ascent (18). The argument is
clinched by Christ's greatest miracles: the raising of Lazarus (20), the
prince's daughter (21), and the dead son of the widow of Naim (22). Elias
reminds Philip that Christ gave his followers the power to resurrect the
dead (23).

Book Eleven:

The meter repeats Elias's reminder that Christ gave his disciples
the power to resurrect the dead (i). Next Elias considers Philip's second
claim. All men agree that there is one all-powerful God (1); just saying
