274 INDEX VERBORUM

Numerical references are to book and line in the Ser-ium senectutis. 1
distinguish between word forms but not between different cases with the
same termination. In the case of classical words which develop post-
classical senses, Ῑ do not provide references for Elias' use of classica]
senses. Orthography follows Sloane 441. As a result, I follow Texerii in
treating ufv and tlc as interchangeable, likewise ily, except when y repre-
sents Greek upsilon. Since the various dictionaries observe different
spelling conventionsl I supply references to lemmata wherever confusion
seems likely to arise. In both definitions and documentation, commas
divide synonyms or closely related senses, while semicolons divide
distinct or unrelated senses. Because the Dictionary ofMedieval Latin from
British Sources provides the most detailed evidence for Elias' immediate
lexical environment, I have recorded its division of senses within lem-
mata whenever that seemed useful; otherwise Ι document senses only by
reference to the lemmata under which they appear.
