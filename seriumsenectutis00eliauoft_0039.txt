otherwise deserves strict punishment (2). This is because sharing power
inevitably leads to conflict (3). Elias pauses briefly to apologize for
borrowing his proofs from other writers (4). Those proofs are the Ambro-
siaster on knowing God through his visible creation (5), a series of
Aristotelian proofs (6-9), Anselm's ontological proof (10), and a claim
that two first principles could not coexist (11). Elias again emphasizes
that he has not thought up these arguments, but does claim to have
adorned them stylistically (12). He reminds Philip that it is onerous to
serve more than one master (13), exhorts him to embrace the immortality
of the soul, one God, and the marriage of soul and tongue (14), and
promises that a faithful servant will be rewarded by sharing his master's

God without marrying mind to tongue (3). The man without friends is

like Damon and Pythias (3-5). Elias proclaims his desire that they live as
friends in charity (6) and ends with a hymn to friendship (ii).

Elias reminds his friend Philip that his arguments are not his own but
have been borrowed from others and adorned by verbal and syntactic
elaboration. Elias probably felt compelled by the seriousness of the topic
under discussion to make such an admission at this point! since it is
equally true of the rest of the Serium senectutis. Virtually all the material
of the work' whether spoken by Elias or Philip, comes from other written
sources. Those parts which do not, the meters and prose passages that
begin and end books, are the most stylistically convoluted and least
substantial of the work. Left to his own devices, Elias tends towards the
rhetorical elaboration of moral commonplaces.
Elias's primary sources are not particularly numerous! but they cover
