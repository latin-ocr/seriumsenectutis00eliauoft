34 INTRODUCTmN

would have known best from his duties as grammar master. Indeed, all
the metra in hexameters contain an even number of lines and are, in fact,
written for the most part as couplets. Elias no doubt intended his transi-
tion from couplets to hexameters to mark the higher seriousness of the
work's second half, but the effect he achieves falls short of this intent.

The most conspicuous characteristics of Elias's verses are heavy
alliteration and word play. He probably intended the alliteration to tie
together verses which are highly paratactic and do not so much ssow as
erupt in short! staccato bursts. The opening lines of the Serium senectutis
set the tone for the work as a whole:

Dum variat studiosus homo sacra coniugiorum
ffedera felici federe crebro caret,

Et superum sacra sponte loquax hominumque reuelat;
Copula fine fide federibus verata

Cum Iove Iunonem! claudum cum Cipride fabrum
Federat, Abderitem copulat atque Team.

The lack of closure in the second couplet is a striking violation of both
the classical norm and Elias's usual practice, but it is repeated in the
fourth couplet of this same metrum. The triple alliteration on s and f
accords with the precepts for paranomeon given by Matthew of Vendome,
as the word play (ffedera' federe, federibus, federat) does with those for
paronomasia.¹¹⁵ In at least one line later in the work! Elias comes close
to achieving complete alliteration: Vix validus volet in viciis vir viuere vanis
(9.7). The meter which this comes from, that prefixed to book 9, also
shows the highest density of paronomasia; as the final meter in elegiac
couplets it is doubtless meant as a bravura showpiece. But little has
changed when we arrive at the hexameters which end the work:

Quam bene iocundum fuerit retro quam sit amenum
Nunc eciam, scius expertis iam sencio factus!
Sponte sua sibi concordes habitare sodales,

Longius et rixas viciumque repellere licis,

Et sibi sensate vitam solidare quietis

Vitales variando vices dumtaxat in vnum.

It is as a writer of prose that Elias comes into his own. Concerned with
stylistic elaboration and metrical exigency, Elias uses rare words only
infrequently in his meters, but he festoons his prose with them. He is
