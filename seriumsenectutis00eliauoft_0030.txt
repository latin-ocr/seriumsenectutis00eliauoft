14 INTRODUCTION

Extraction, wrote a Book con tra Nobilitatem inanem. He is conjectured to
have flourished about the year 1266.⁶¹

Because Fuller acknowledges Leland and Rale's ignorance of when Elias
lived, his floruit 1266 is a surprise, it may have its ultimate source in a
work published a century earlier, the second edition of Matthias Flacius
Illyricus¹s Catalogus testium ueritatis.⁶²

The title page to his Bibliotheca Britannico-Hibernica claims that Thomas
Tanner includes writers overlooked by Leland, Bale, and Pits and also
supplies omissions, corrects, and illustrates his material with abundant
noteS,⁶³ but his entry for Elias is notable, in fact, for its reliance on the
earlier antiquarians and for its brevity:

RUBEUS, [HELIAS] saw daylight in the town of Thriplow in Cam-
bridgeshire, was a graduate of the University of Cambridge, where
he spent some years studying philosophy and theology, then a royal
chaplain. He wrote Contra nobilitatem inanem in one book. He is said

to have been alive in 1280.⁶⁴

His claim that Elias was capellanus regius is original, but we must not
accept it uncritically. Tanner offers no documentation for his claim, and
there is nothing in the records which still survive to corroborate it.⁶⁵ It
is unlikely, albeit not impossible, that a royal chaplain would be father to
one or more sons, as is the Elias we know from the Ely accounts. Finally,
this claim is all too easily explained as an attempt to make Bale's account
of Elias at court look more plausible by making it more circumstantial.
While we may prefer Tanner's dein capellanus regius to Pits's tedious

saffron, and willows (143-44).

⁶³ Thomas Tanner, Bibliotheca Britannico-Hibernica,· sive de scriptoribus qui in Anglia, Sootia,
et Hibernia ad saeculi xvii initium floruerunt, literarum ordine Juxta familiarum nomina dispositis
Commentarius (London: lmpensis Societatis ad literas promovendas, 1749). As good as his
word, Tanner indexes Elias under his family name Rubeus. His alphabetical scheme betrays
a bias towards analytical classification, while Bale's chronological ordering hints at a
stronger desire to implicate individual authors in a larger history. For the apocalyptic tenor
of that history, see Katherine R. Firth, 'Ihe Apocalyptic Tradition in Reformation Britain 1530-
1645 (Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 1979), 32-68, and John N. King, English Reformation

1982), 56-75, 418-29.

⁶⁵ However, the author of the Petronius rediuiuus does mention having frequently seen
a certain 1- of London: ‘¹1 quendam sepissime uidi Lundoniensem'¹ (Analecta Dublinensia,
ed. Colker, 199). But as Colker notes (182), the author does not say where these encounters
took place.
