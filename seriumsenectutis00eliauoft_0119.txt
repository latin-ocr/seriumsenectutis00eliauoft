BOOK THREE 103

wearied them with long embraces and kisses too eager to be within
the bounds of sincere affection.

[30] But when he arrived at the city gate, he suddenly ordered
his soldiers to occupy the citadel and hasten the destiny of the boys
with fatal steel. They fled in misery to their lamenting mother but
were slain in her lap amidst her kisses, while Arsinoe miserably
proclaimed that she had incurred such a horror by her marriage or
its aftermath. She repeatedly tried to expose herself to the lethal
blows intended for her sons by their persecutors, holding her sons
in a maternal embrace, she often shielded their bodies with her
own. But finally, made destitute by the abominable deaths of her
sonS, she was expelled by force from the city, accompanied only by
two young slaves, and went in misery to Samothrace, abandoned to
inexorable exile. Her greatest misery was that she was unable to die
with her sons, which would have been the supreme solace to her

[31.] Ptolemy's abominable crimes, including these supreme
abominations, did not remain unpunished: at long last Jove pursued
so many perjuries, such bloody parricides achieved through fraud

land could not contain all those it gave birth to, they sent 300,ooo of

slaughtering barbarians along the way, and settled in Pannonia.
They were a daring and tough people, wise and extremely bellicose,
who were the first men after Hercules (for whom the same feat won
perpetual praise, admiration for his virtue, and faith in his immor-
tality) to cross the icy cliffs and many ridges of the Alps, afflicted
by the cold and enveloped in packed snow. Having pacified the
Pannonians, they waged war for many years against their immedi-
ate neighbors. Their frequent and great success suggested that they
should divide their troops: some went to Greece, others to Macedo-
nia, overthrowing everything with the sword.

[32] The Gauls aroused such fear that even kings and princes of
nations not under attack sought to purchase peace for themselves
