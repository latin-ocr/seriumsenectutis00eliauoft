integrity of truth which faithful believers of the Catholic faith might
use to argue the immortality of the human soul. Since they are
pleasing by nature, they please even more when often repeated. We
will begin with the supreme work of the supreme Mediator during
His public ministry on earth. I ask that no one confront me with the
rebuke that 1 have contumaciously presumed to set my face against
⁵ heaven by beginning my argument here from such sublime actions.

[20.] The man Jesus, God and son of God, an unconstrained judge
of infinite power, called Lazarus, the brother of Mary and Martha,
back to life from the grave and restored him to vitality after he had
been buried in his sepulchre for four days and stank under the
lethally hot southern sun. This can be taken as clear proof that the
condition of mortality has no power over the human soul. You may
implicitly understand from this special restitution of his animal
spirit that Lazarus's dead body was revivified by the living God's
powerful recall of his soul. Not because the absolute power of the

pleased Him, but so we might draw from the suppliant words of
Elisha in a similar case the defense of the extreme presumption of
the suppliant widow that the soul of her dead son returned to its

the power of divine virtue, serves as plausible proof of the unfailing
vitality of the soul. For when the preeminently powerful and unlim-
ited physician, who was easily swayed to lend an ear, was moved
by the firm saith of the suppliant prince to approach his daughter
for the purpose of reviving her, clearly he did not fail to achieve the
outcome sought by the prince, although he was derided by a foolish
mob of citizens whom he forced to move back by asserting the truth
that she was not dead. Holding the dead girl's hand in His, He
recalled her soul from unconquerable mortality to the accustomed
possession of its dwelling and restored her to her living compan-
ions. So if you please, you should keep in mind that in a similar
