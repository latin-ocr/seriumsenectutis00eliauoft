BOOK FOUR 139

entwined by these snakes, by which we may understand the rectiâ€”
tude of rhetoric and the rigor and inflexibility of justice, the top is
said to be gold, the middle grayish, and the bottom pitch black. The
speech of rhetoricians appears attractive at the outset, grows rough-
er in the middle, and darkens in final condemnation. They also say
Mercury' s ssying wand is called the caduceus for a reason: eloquent
speech often causes disputes and quarrels to cease. For those who
effectively use their eloquence to make brawls and conflicts end in
confirmed peace are called bearers of the caduceus, or heralds.

[22] Nor would your impudent spleen fail to move you to an
untimely and anomalous guffaw at what the same author writes
about Philology when she is about to ascend to the gods. He says
that having been made immortal, the virgin Philology petitioned
Athanasia and her mother Apotheosis, rendering thanks to them
with much sacrifice, so that in passing over to immortality she did
not see Vedius, nor did Vedius burn her with fire or bathe her in
water, nor scourge the likeness of her soul according to the doctrine
of some Syrian, nor by the rite of old Colchis consecrate her immor-
tality under the auspices of death, concealed in the hands of Char-
on. But unless presuppositions based on your impetuosity deceive
me, which has rarely been the case, you would suddenly bristle and
fatuously turn up your nose at such dialogue, because (according to
your customary and detestable practice) you would insist on con-
sidering only the superficial cruelties. You would obstinately object
to the virgin's offerings to Immortality from her own incense box,
the scorching fire and baths appointed for immortality, not to
mention the likeness of the soul and the vain and absurd scourging
of that likeness, and immortality concealed in the hands of Charon
without, or under, the auspices of death.
