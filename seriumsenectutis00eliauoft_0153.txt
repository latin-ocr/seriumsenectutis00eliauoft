quent and articulate, is derided by the Cyprian, that is, by the man
who is endowed with sustaining wisdom and eloquence. For the
naked genitals of boys in whom the sexual urge is not yet actively
flourishing do not deserve Venus's laughter.

[20.] Nor, as I imagine, would you easily pass over without
reproof the same author's claim, made in all seriousness, that
Mercury, before successfully approaching Phoebus at the suggestion
of Virtue, granted his flying wand to virtue so she might traverse
the remotest parts of the world with him and penetrate the ethereal
recesses with equal swiftneSS, while he proceeded to bind silver
sandals (that is, a petasus or winged footwear) on his own feet.
Moreover, it seems to me that you would immediately chatter about
the wrong-headedness of the wand's ability to fly and the shoe's

by those winged sandals: by this you may understand the swiftness
of his star or the rapidity of eloquent speech.

[21.] His flying wand is said to be entwined by two snakes, in
order that you might contemplate the oft poisonous words of
rhetoricians, or their prickly and pointed eloquence. As to the wand
