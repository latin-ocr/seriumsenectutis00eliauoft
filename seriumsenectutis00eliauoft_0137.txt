[2.] Î™ cannot imagine that any wise man would consider your
obstinate urge to reveal your impetuosity sensible. If you possessed
any intelligence you should have remembered (especially since it
suited us to be mindful then, but now suits us to dissemble) that
among the diffuse beginnings of your ridiculously confused oration

or mind to wish to move on lustfully to objects of desire and inti-
mate associations. You did not cease to substitute your stupid
