BOOK THIRTEEN 223

He did show some mercy to the condemned in one respect, since he
granted a period of grace which the unhappy man sought for
setting his sad household in order, on the condition that his com·
panion Damon be left behind as surety if he were willing. Damon
agreed freely with constant mind and countenance to be led off to
death if Pythias failed to return on time. He surrendered himself
and remained behind as surety, to be derided by all as laughably
deluded.

[5.] Everyone, but especially King Dionysius himself, awaited the
outcome of this scarce doubtful matter, and together they heaped
scorn on Damon's rash undertaking. Finally, as the day fixed for
Pythias's return approached, Damon was derided by all but contin-
ued to show himself confident in countenance and speech, sure as
he was of his companion's constant fidelity. Nor, in the end, did his
constancy betray this man who was so secure in the fn'endship of
his companion. For Pythias returned faithfully on the day and hour
that Dionysius had appointed in advance, hastening with constancy
to his fate. Soon the tyrant Dionysius, admiring the spirit of such
constant friends and having grown more humane than was his
custom, remitted their punishment and asked that he be made a
third member of this unique partnership, albeit he had been utterly
unsuited by his disposition and actions for such constant fidelity of
spirit.

[6.] Reverence for virtue and reason often ssourishes even among
the immoral, and often creates unexpected results. The admirable
force and vigor of friendship will achieve what the contempt of
death, which all men naturally spurn and abominate by instinct,
often places in the minds of the living; it continues to flavor the
conditions of vitality, the length of life and its twists and turns,
with the sweetness of living together harmoniously. Se, my com-
panion, let us follow the example of these two friends and abandon
all conflicts and quarrels to persist in the harmony of faithful
partnership, flavoring life with the continual sweetness of mutual
charity, the most excellent of the three virtues.

How rightfully joyful it was and how pleasant,
Even ηοω, Ῑ sense, made wise by experience,

For harmonious companions to live together freely,
Rebuff brawls and vicious disagreement,
