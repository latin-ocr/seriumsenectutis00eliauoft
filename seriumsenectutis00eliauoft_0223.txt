BOOK ELEVEN 207

thus be God and the cause of all created things. Otherwise, it would
be easy to demonstrate that some created thing existed from eterni-
ty, although it is impossible to comprehend the existence of a
creature which was not allotted its beginning by another. Thus it
must needs be manifest that there is only one origin of the universe,
which is God.

[1o.] To continue speaking about such praiseworthy material, if
by chance there is anything which proves to be God, surely no one
will deny that it must be that which cannot not be. Thus, if any-
thing is God, it cannot not be: whatever cannot not be is God. The
logic of the proof is grounded in this: the truth of the hypothesis
that if something is God it cannot not be requires that God could
not not be. Assuming the opposite, it does not follow that if some-
thing is God it could not not be, but rather that it could not be, and
this follows as a necessary consequence. It is impossible for God not
to exist. Thus it is necessary that he exist. We may even add, if you
please, that it is apparent that if something is God, without this God
nothing could be good,· therefore, if anything is good, God exists.

[11.] So it is manifest for many necessary reasons that God exists
and is one, without any multiplicity of gods. For if there were two
gods or first principles, either both would be insufficient or one
superfluous. If either lacked something the other had, it would not
be established in consummate perfectiori. But if neither had what
the other lacked, either would suffice for everything and the other
would be superfluous, or they would frequently fall into discord
from brooding on their sharing, especially since sharing is a fecund
mother of altercations, which are always to be avoided, and an
unwearied instigator of continual envy. In this world, this delightful
conclave of afflictione, that man, God's living creation, who does
not choose one God as his supreme support and unique safeguard
should be considered base and senseless by all. In fact, the culpable
man who lives inevitably destined to a fatal end, for whose salva-
tion one God will not suffice, is unreasonably mean· ·spirited and
subhumanly feeble in spirit.
