BOOK FOUR 131

[14.] He soon adds: “Blessed is he that shall take and dash his
little ones against the rock.‘' In fact, the man whom others will
consider blessed is the man who, lest they grow minome and
flourish to the point of danger, takes and dashes upon the rock,
which is Christ, those first motions of the spirit born depraved from
the flesh (namely the tiny sons born from the Daughter of Babylon),
so that broken and forestalled by timely haste, they might perish
inwardly before achieving maturity. Indeed, the flesh is rightly said
to be the daughter and nursling of Babylon. For as the unwearied
and vigilant adversary of virtue, she is accustomed to lavish the
anarchy of the vices upon man. As she incites man to pursue
forbidden goods, her fit recompense is to be constrained to serve
humbly, subject to the virtues. Her children, because they are
base-bom and try to strangle their own parents in sin and excess,
even struggle to pervert them with their errors, are best forestalled
by such remuneration. While they are still small and helpless,
before they come to the virile strength of men, a recognition of the
true God fatally dashes them on the rock without endangering the
good man. But if they should chance to grow swiftly to manhood,
though they seem a hindrance, even then let them perish on the
obstacle of resistance. In the pure light of such an explanation, what
seems by the test of rude and anomalous effrontery the silly and
irregular incompatibility of beatitude with the slaughter of one's
own children is established in the apposite appearance of concord.

shall be filled which he hath planted.'' Lest you immediately pre·

hasty and impudent mocker, as if the filling of trees or satiety of
cedars were senselessly absurd and fundamentally out of harmony
with logic or ordinary speech, and so that you might wallow more
temperately in your temerity and consider such plain expressions
only superficially in disharmony (as you would have it), do not
