BOOK SEVEN 159

of a double reward and punished brutally for his lie. Even though
he did not blush at his own manifest falsehood, Battus was unable
to betray Mercury to the god himself in disguise; indeed, the fast-
talking rustic was quickly outwitted and suffered the punishment
consequent upon such mad behavior. If we are for the moment to
give proper credence to the words of Antiquity, Mercury perma-
nently metamorphosed the madly audacious liar into silent flint.
Thus he put a well-deserved end to Battus's mendacity. But even
men of higher station have suffered the brunt of punishment for
lies.

[4.] An equally familiar and well-worn commonplace, 1 imagine,
is the history of the explorers sent by Moses' command to explore
the Promised Land, and the punishment of most (but not all) for
their gratuitous lies about that land. Indeed, to repeat a matter of
common knowledge, Moses—a man of high morals, but at the same
time mild, patient, and circumspect—wisely sent twelve men to
explore the Promised Land: from the tribe of Ephraim, Joshua the
son of Num from the tribe of Juda, Caleb the son of Jephone; and
the remaining ten named according to their several tribes. But all
except Joshua, as if leagued together by prior consent, lied openly
and without shame about the land's condition, geography, and
popular assembly; nor did they recoil from the false claim that such
a powerful nation could not be overcome by such a feeble one, or
so many be subdued by so feW. They lied about an abundance of
cities with impregnable walls and multitudes of valiant and invinci-
ble men. And they published the barefaced lie that the land de-
voured its inhabitants. But in the end they did not speak such utter
falsehoods with impunity, for the Lord—the supreme and invincible
might of the highest godhead—struck with punishment all those
whom Moses had sent to explore the Promised Land, with the
exception of Joshua and Caleb.
