elsewhere.⁴⁹ It may also be that Elias joined a religious order such as
that of the Dominicansl which would have afforded him an opportunity
for further learning before writing the Serium senectutis.

Did Elias frequent court? Again there is no external evidence t<
corroborate Bale's claim that he did, and nothing in the surviving works
to indicate Elias's acquaintance with any particular court as opposed to
moral or satirical commonplaces about courts.⁵⁰ If we again entertain
the suspicion that Bale's account of Elias's career is really an embroidery
on the title ot' the one work known to Bale, Contra nobilitatem inanem, we
will find corroboration in the admission of Bale's biographer that “where
he has few definite details at his disposal he does not hesitate to expand
his scanty facts by the addition of ¹ purple passages' which have practical-
ly no value save that of tradition.''⁵¹

But while we may doubt whether Bale's claim that Elias was '‘out-
standing for humanity and prudence, nobly instructed in many branches
of knowledge'‘ derives from any great acquaintance with the man and
his works, it would be unfair to leave the matter there. For despite the
inevitable errors of fact, the purple passages, and the acerbic Protestant-
ism which earned him the sobriquet “Bilious Balel' Bale established with
his Summarium and Catalogus a basis for the study of British writers for
two centuries. He and Leland worked at a time when manuscripts were
perishing wholesale in the aftermath of Henry VIII's suppression of the
monasteries. And Bale did his work without Leland's royal backing or
the connections and wealth Matthew Parker possessed as archbishop of

Richard of [eycestria (circa 1222-1232) who was himself a canonist. Civil law was taught
there extraordinarie as an adjunct to canon law before 1250 (Hackett, Original Statutes, 130-
31). The civil law faculty probably dates from the late 1230s or early 124os and was

printed or calendared thus tar occurs in an entry in the Curia Regis rolls for Essex in 1206:
Matillis filia Gaufridi queritur quod Willelmus le Bedellus et Elias Ruffus et Rogerus
frater Clementis et Gaufridus Serviens et Robertus le Bacheler in pace domini regis
eam robaverunt et abstulerunt in felonia i. chevise et i. tunicam et duas ulnas linee

This is not the lsort of gehavior we would have expected of the future author of the serium
senectutis, although it does recall a notorious entry in Geoffrey Chaucer‘s police blotter.
