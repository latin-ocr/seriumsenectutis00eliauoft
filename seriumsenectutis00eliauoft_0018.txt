for direct influence in either direction. Unfortunately, this is not the last
time we will see a literary historian turn a predecessor's speculation
about Elias of Thriplow into fact.

The study of Elias's life and work reaches maturity in Paul Gerhard
Schmidt's exemplary paper “Elias of Thriplow—A Thirteenth-Century
Anglo-Latin Poet.''⁵ Schmidt argues, correctly I believe, that De vita
scolarium and Contra nobilitatem are two separate works, not two titles for
the same work as Smalley had thought,·⁶ even so, he more than manages
to double the number of works attributable to Elias. Besides discovering
Whethamstede's own tabula or subject index to De vita scolarium in British
Library, MS Arundel11, Schmidt has also drawn attention to paraphrases
and excerpts from Elias's Semidiales, or “Demigodsl' in the second
edition of Matthias Flacius Illyricus's Catalogus testium ueritatis, or “wit-
nesses of the Truth'' (Basel, 1562).⁷ Most importantly, he has located a
complete work by Elias, the Serium senectutis, or “Grave Thoughts in Old
Age,'' which is preserved in a unique manuscript, British Library, Sloane
441. According to its colophon, the Serium senectutis was copied in the
Dominican convent at Brecon, Wales by Bartholomew Texerii, O.P.
Schmidt argues convincingly that since Texerii was Master General of the
Dominican order from 1426 to 1449, he probably copied Elias's work
before 1426.8

More recently, Marvin Colker and I have independently concluded
that Elias is probably also the author of a work which Colker has edited
as A Collection of Stories and Sketches: Petronius rediuiuus.⁹ The Petronius
rediuiuus is a prosimetrum in fourteen books which survives without
attribution in Dublin, Trinity College, MS 602, an English manuscript of
the early thirteenth century.¹⁰ If its attribution to Elias is accepted, the
Trinity College manuscript becomes by far the earliest surviving copy of
a work by our author and so a potentially important witness to his
language and style, as well as his early readership.¹¹
