grammar school, indeed, it had long been known for the education “of
princelings and nobles.''³⁶ And while there were no “cloister children''
at Ely after the mid-thirteenth century, there was a school in the almonry
where poor boys were taught by a secular clerk. But the first known
master appears only circa 1541 .³⁷ Likewise, our earliest evidence for any
specific grammar school in Cambridge dates only from 1276.³⁸ But the
foundation and growth of the University of Cambridge must have led to
a proliferation of schools which taught grammar, that is, Latin language
and literature, to the high standards required for entry into the universi-
ty.³⁹ Moreover, while Elias lived at the time when university curricula
were being restructured around Aristotelian philosophy, grammar
remained a subject of intense study in the arts faculty.⁴⁰ In fact, the
Angelica manuscript which contains the original statutes of Cambridge
University is, as its editor M. B. Hackett has recognized, a grammarian‘s
book from the first half of the thirteenth century which would have
appealed to a master of arts such as the Cambridge grammarian Nicholas
of Breckendale.⁴¹¹ Nor would connections in Ely have failed Elias if he
sought to teach grammar in Cambridge, since even after the establish-
