man corrupted by excessive wealth, debased by inhuman cruelty, or
enraged against his gods by proud delusion, should show any
self-restraint worth praising. Anyone who does not blush to live in
defiance of God and the integrity of religion will be slow to live
humanely among men. Any arrogant fool who is not afraid to
spurn the reverence of the gods or the potency of the heavenly

[12] Since it is still permissible to frolic in the broad domains of
ancient foolery, the studied severity of the Delphic godhead's
vengeance upon the harm intended him by Xerxes, King of Persia,

Greeks, his shameful departure in ssight was supremely worthy of
their ridicule.

4,ooo soldiers, took up the defensive position he had already scout-
