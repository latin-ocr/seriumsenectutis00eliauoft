suggested that in his lost De vita scolarium Elias adapts the prosimetric
form of Boethius to the subject matter of the pseudo-Boethian De disci-
plina scolarium.⁹⁸ In the Serium senectutis, we might say, he adapts the
style and central conceit of Martianus Capella's Marriage of Mercury and
Philology to the form and telos of Boethius¹s Consolation.

With his long periods, his delight in periphrasis, and his frequent use
of rariora, Elias writes in the Asiatic tradition of which Martianus was
one of the chief exemplars for the Latin Middle Ages. Indeed, we may
properly speak of a Menippean lexicon at play in the Serium senectutis.
Again and again one comes across words which do not appear in the
standard dictionaries but find their place in the index verborum to any
edition of Martianus. For example, three times in the course of his work
Elias plays variations on Horace's claim (Sermones 1.7.3) that Persius's
vengeance on the outlaw Rupilius Rex was ‘'known to every bleary-eyed
man and barber in town'' (omnibus et lippis notum et tonsoribus). One
variation involves “the bleary-eyed and those unable to see out of one
eye'' (lippis non minus quam luscis lumine cecutientibus). Elias found the
word in Martianus Capella (1.3 [221-221), who writes of “poets who fol-
lowed the Oeagrian lyre player and the sweet-spoken old age of the
blind Maeonian'' (poetae... praecipue Oeagrium citharistam secuti caecutien-
tisque Maeonii suaviloquam senectutem). And from Martianus, the word's
lineage stretches back to Varro's Menippeae and Apuleius's Florida.⁹⁹

Elias concerned himself with more than just Martianus's style. The
whole 'first half of the Serium senectutis should be read as a defense of
literary meaning and figurative expression. That defense culminates in
book 4, where Elias saves first a series of biblical verses and then four
passages in Martianus's De nuptiis from the superficial appearance of
blasphemy or absurdity by evoking standard allegorical readings from
the Glossa ordinaria and Remigius of Auxerre's Commentary, respectively.
Unlike fourteenth-century authors such as Pierre Bersuire or Smalley's
classicizing friars, Elias does not claim any specifically Christian sense for
his pagan author Martianus.¹⁰⁰ But his juxtaposition of biblica] and

⁹⁹ For documentation, see the Thesaurus linguae Latinae, s.v. Elias also uses the word in

his Semidiales, where according to Flacius, he wrote of the pope viewing the fairness of the
law with oculo . . . caecutienti (Catalogus testium ueritatis, 448).

tary Tradition, revised ed. (Oxfordz Clarendon Press, 1991), 314-72. Early in the twelfth
century, Conrad of Hirsau had used Judges 9.8 (¹¹'1'he trees went to anoint a king over
them: and they said to the olive tree: Reign thou over us'') to justify the use of allegory in
secular works, and he even argued briefly for the presence of a fourfold sense in such
secular allegory (Minnis and Scott, Medieval Literary Theory, 45-48). But neither he nor any
