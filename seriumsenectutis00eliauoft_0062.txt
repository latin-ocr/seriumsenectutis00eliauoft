wavers some in his treatment of labials. Forffv alternation' note invatuata
(3.88 van), butfacillantis (4.455) and facillitas (from vacillo& 3.171). For vlb,
note diouolaris and diouolariter, although this spelling is attested earlier by
the Thesaurus linguae Latinae. Merculialis (4.297 υαν.) and the twin forms
diouolariterldiouolaliter testify to a slight uncertainty about liquids.

Texerii normally treats enclitic -ve as a separate! or rather semi-sepa-
rate, word.¹⁴⁸ At times he treats the conjunction —que in the same man-
ner.¹4⁹ So, while a case could be made for printing them as separate
words, printing them as enclitics is just as faithful to the manuscript and
more in accord with normal editorial usage.

This edition prints names as they appear in Sloane 441 since it is often
impossible to determine whether spellings which diverge from those in
modern printed editions of Elias's sources are to be attributed to variants
in the manuscripts consulted by Elias, to the transmission of Elias's text,
or simply to the differing norms of classical and medieval orthography.
However, the textual apparatus records source readings and variants on
the first appearance of most names. Where possible! the commentary tries
to assess which manuscript families Elias worked from.

Numbers are spelled out or left as Roman numerals according to how
they appear in the manuscript. Notice' however, duodecim (xiicim) at 7.60.

The textual apparatus records all substantive divergences from the text
of Sloane 441. But the manuscript also contains corrections in several
hands, as well as its share of insignificant slips of the pen. While a record
of those slips and corrections would unduly burden the apparatus, its
inclusion below in appendix 3 will allow readers to reconstruct every
reading and correction in the Sloane copy of the Serium senectutis. As that
copy is our only witness to a difficult text, serious readers will want to
consider this record with care.

All references to the Serium senectutis are keyed to book and line in this
edition.

¹⁴⁸ Note, however, legittimaue (1.46) and animane (1255).
