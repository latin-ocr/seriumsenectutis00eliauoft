BOOK THIRTEEN

And sensibly establish for themselves a quiet life

By living life's vicissitudes together.

Indeed, it is quite shameful for companions to disagree,
Divided in spirit, associate only in the flesh,

And live together disconnected in mind in the base
Manner of travellers, who care only for their daily rations,
Whose newly undertaken friendships end at their outset,
And whose first associations conceive a hasty terminus;
Instead, companions establish a source of comfort

In their partnership, and should strive to ssavor the passage
Of time and constraint of manners with a sensible solace;

True faith should love saith, and cherish him who cherishes,

While the faithful hold their own things in common,-

It is brilliantly apparent, although utterly commonplace,
That a man who lacks friends does not live well:

If he falls or lies prostrate, he will be slow to rise.

So let us live together without dissent, and to the limit
Of our powers banish conflicts far from us;

Let us thoroughly cherish the laws of partnership,

So we might ssavor life with a forceful measure

And drive dislikes far from us,·

Our partnership will know only peace,

So we will, once altered, refuse to live basely,
And strive forcefully to live a fit life.

Here end The Grave Tkoughts in Old Age of Elias
Rubeus of Thriplow, copied by brother
Bartholomew Texerii, O.P., while dwelling
in the convent of the same order at Brecon.
