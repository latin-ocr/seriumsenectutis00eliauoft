20 INTRODUCTION

pagans mention how their gods avenged lies and other transgressions (2).
Philip backs his assertion by excerpting material that treats lies from the
Psalms (3-5) and rehearsing the fatal end of the man born of an Egyptian
and an Israelite who dared blaspheme against God (6). But an objection
arises: is God too harsh in punishing blasphemy with death (7)? Certain-
ly human law does not propose such a stiff penalty for slandering an em-
peror (8),· besides, demons delight in spilling human blood, not God (9).
Philip then offers several Old Testament examples of God's vengeance
on the Israelites' apostasy. The murmurs of the Israelites in the wilder-
ness cause God to consume the outer part of their camp with flame (1o);
soon afterwards they spurn the manna (11), and Miriam revolts against
her brother Moses (12). The explorers sent to the Promised Land return
with a false report (13-14), and Chore and Dathan lead another revolt (15-
16), in every case the malefactors meet a bad end. Another rebellion (17)
and the worship of the golden calf (18-19) prove equally fatal. Philip con-
cludes the book by advancing Moses as a model for all judges (20—22).

Book Three:

After a poem urging man to serve God without murmuring (i),
Philip enters an extended discussion of the vengeance various pagan
gods exacted for blasphemy or other sins against their worship. The gods
and the mortals who offend them are Mercury and Battus (1—4), Bacchus
and Pentheus (5), Jove and the Syrian king Alexander (6-8), Jove and
Cambyses (9-11), Apollo and Xerxes (12-21), Minerva and the Metapon-
tines and Sybaritans (22), Hercules and the Potitii (23), Apollo and the
Romans who stole a golden vest from his statue (24), Aesculapius and
Turullius (25), Jupiter and Ptolemy of Macedonia (26-34), Apollo and the
Gaul Brennus (35—42), Juno and the Censor Fulvius (43), and Juno and
Pyrrhus of Epirus (44). Such stories should make us fear lying, says
Philip, but they should not pervert our normal manner of speech (45).
Tau< of a marriage between mind and tongue is patently absurd (46), and
Elias should write about topics which mix profit with delight (47).

Book Four:

The opening meter recapitulates Philip's concern that people act
as their peers do (i). Elias replies by labelling Philip rash and obstinate
(1). He summarizes Philip's argument (2—4), then proposes that it con-
tains an implicit criticism of those who have spoken God's word, as well
as pagan philosophers (5). Elias launches a defense of figurative expres-
sion by adducing biblical texts and their standard allegorical readings:
the Bride and Groom of the Song of Songs (6-7), the Heavenly Jerusalem
in Apocalypse (8), and a number of verses from the Psalms (9-15). Hav-
