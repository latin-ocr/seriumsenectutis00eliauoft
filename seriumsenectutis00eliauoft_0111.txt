BOOK THREE 95

[20] Νοι· were the hordes of soldiers whom Xerxes had con-
signed to the leadership of his generals more fortunate in their
passage. Doomed as they were to daily struggle (indeed, rest is rare
for those in constant fear), short rations and hunger harmed them
severely. Then, when abundant provisions and an excess of food
and drink put an end to the famine, they afflicted those who de-
voured too much with a fatal plague. So many of the stricken died
that the pestilence contracted from the heaps of rotting bodies
fatally infected the roads, and the vast multitudes of the dead and
dying attracted masses of birds and beasts of prey.

[21.] His injustice was crowned by one final misdeed. When
Xerxes, king of Persia and once scourge of the world, reentered his
native land after having waged such a miserable and ruinous war
in Greece, he found himself held in contempt by his own people as

Xerxes. He rightfully slaughtered the king and so put an end to his

the injuries which the Metapontines, Sybaritans, and Crotonians
inflicted on her when they banded together to drive the other
Greeks from Italy. All alike fired by their objective, they began by
storming the city of Heraclea and slaughtering fifty youths who, as
the city was being stormed, had ssed for sanctuary to the temple of
Minerva and (as often happens) had reverently embraced the
goddess's likeness. They even slaughtered her priest, clothed in the
divine vestments and insignia, at the altar itself. But on account of
this sacrilegious crime, which was quite outrageous in light of
where it took place, the goddess (as Antiquity, deluded and in-
clined to vanities, claims) confounded these contumacious men with
a fatal pestilence and buffeted them with turbulent discord. But
