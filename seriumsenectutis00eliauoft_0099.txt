BOOK THREE 83

[7 .] But since it is, and always has been, the vice of the base-born
to fall easy prey to ingratitude, Alexander, swelling rashly with
pride because of the successful outcome of events, began in his
insolence to spurn and insult even Ptolemy, through whose feigning
counsels and military support he had been dressed up as king of
Syria. But Ptolemy, still not altogether lacking in subtlety of counsel
or fictional stratagems, set out with all his resources and imagina-
tive stratagems to deprive Alexander of the kingship which he had
helped him to acquire with his brains and might. So he sent his
grandson Grypos to Syria with a massive army, and publicly prom-
ised him his daughter in marriage, so as to win the people of Syria
over to his grandson's aid not only by military alliance but by
affinity of blood and close kinship. Nor did his plot, thus conceived,
fail of a suitable outcome. For when all the Syrians saw Grypos
supplied with so many Egyptian troops, they gradually gave
thought to their safety and defected from Alexander as if by com-

defeated and departed from Antioch in base flight.

hunger, Alexander withheld the wages due his troops, and his
soldiers lacked remuneration for their labors because of their lead-

the removal of a solid gold victory standard from Jove's temple.
Nor was he afraid to embellish the sacrilege with elever jokes in the
rash style of a Syracusan tyrant. He said that victory had been
entrusted to him by Jove, not aware that his suicidal action and
absurd boast of Jove's favor had hastened the approach of his own
demise. A few days later he secretly ordered his mento pull down
the immensely heavy gold likeness of Jove, but he was caught in
the act of sacrilege by an infinite multitude of people. Turned in
ssight and ignominiously deserted by his people, this base man was
subsequently overwhelmed by a great storm, and with the divine
godhead of Jove exacting this savage vengeance as punishment for
the sacrilege Alexander had committed, he was finally captured by
thieves, brought before Grypos, and put to death. The fool learned
from his fatal end that anyone who basely presumes to embrace the
vice of ingratitude is hateful to all, and that it is typical of the fool
