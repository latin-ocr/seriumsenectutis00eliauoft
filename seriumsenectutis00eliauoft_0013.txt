Preface

This is the first edition of the Serium senectutis, an Anglo-Latin Menip-
pean satire of the thirteenth century. Little is known of its author, Elias
of Thriplow, who takes his cognomen from a small village, outside Cam-
bridge, where he held land from the Bishop of Ely. The Serium senectutis
survives in a unique manuscript, British Library, Sloane 441, which was
copied in the early fifteenth century. It is a difficult work. Inventive and
idiosyncratic in its diction, its complex syntax often obscure and some-
times faulty, the Serium senectutis does not so much articulate a continu-
ous argument as hint at one. Few people will master its literary design in
one or two readings, and there can be little doubt that the author intend-
ed things to be this way.

I have tried to make as much sense as possible of the Serium senectutis.
ΤΙιε editorial principles Ι have adopted to this end are addressed in the
introduction. Particularly difficult passages are discussed in the commen-
tary, readers will also want to consult the translation and index verborum
for implicit commentary on such passages. Often Elias's style is so
periphrastic, even vague, that passages not obviously corrupt are hard to
comprehend; in such cases, the plot summary which appears in section
5 of the introduction, “Contents,'' is worth consulting. Many readers will
want to begin there. All translations from the Bible are from the Douay—
Rheims version, except where it diverges from Elias's Latin text. All other
translations are my own.

I am extremely grateful to Dr. Nigel Palmer for introducing me to Elias,
and to Professor Paul Gerhard Schmidt for encouraging me to edit a work
which he first brought to the attention of scholam. For help with specific
points Ι am indebted to Dr. Chris Lewis, Dr. Margaret Nickson, Mr. J. M.
Farrar, Dr. D. M. Owen, Professor James Carley, Professor Eleonore Stump,
Dr. M. C. Davies, Professor Sten Ebbesen, Dr. D. R. Howlett, Mr. R. Sharpe,
Dr. R. W. Lovatt, Mr. M. G. Underwood, Dr. Charles Burnett, Professor
Daniel Kinney, and Professor A. G. Watson. Their individua] contributions
are noted in the appropriate places, but I cannot pass over here the extraor—
dinary interest and kindness with which they answered my inquiries,
served me coffee, sharpened my thinking, and covered some of the gaps in
my research.

For kindly permitting me access to their collections, Ι wish to thank the
Master, Fellows, and Scholars of St. John's College, Cambridge, and the
