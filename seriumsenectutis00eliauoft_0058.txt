Sloane 441 is written in Secretary throughout, but in a hierarchy of
three gradations: a bastard Secretary book hand for the text of Ps.-Dio-
nysiuS, a Secretary book hand for the texts of Elias and Fulgentius, and
a glossing hand for the commentaries on Ps.-Dionysius.¹³⁹ For his copy
of the Serium senectutis, Texerii uses an informal Secretary hand, upright
and with a minimum of splay. He clearly meant his script to be intelligi-
ble but easy to write: he rarely attempts any calligraphic elaboration of
individual letters, but he distinguishes precisely between the various
letters formed with minims.

With the exception of a more current Secretary hand which appears on
the top of fol. 85v and completes the Fulgentius, the whole volume forms
a unit. As the rubrics share a characteristic curved p with the text script,
it would be sensible to conclude that Texerii wrote the entire volume,
except for the last twenty-five folios, then rubricated and decorated it
after it had been completed by a second hand. Such a conclusion is
strengthened by the rather un-English appearance of the initial on fol. 1¹.
As further confirmation, we might note that the rubric to book 6, on the
bottomfof fol. 37V, has been corrected by Texerii using the same brown
inl< he employed for the text.

Texerii's hand in the Serium senectutis resembles other Secretary hands
of the first quarter of the fifteenth century, and is consistent with the
dating before 1426 which Schmidt arrived at on historical grounds.¹⁴⁰

The manuscript is marked “Bern. 56‘' in Sloane's hand at the top of fol.
1¹. This indicates that Sloane acquired the manuscript from the library of
Dr. Francis Bernard, which was dispersed after Bemard's death in 1698.
The number “56'' refers to an item number in the catalogue of Bemard's
manuscripts contained in Edward Bemard's Catalogi librorum manuscripto-

¹³⁸ Dionysiaca, 2:1289-91, 1293-98, 1299—1300, 1316-18, 1403-8.
