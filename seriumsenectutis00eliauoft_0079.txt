BOOK Two 63

for the severe and long-standing edict that any man of whatever
condition who presumes to abuse his God or blaspheme against His
name with vain or stupid speech should be consigned to death by
the covenant and suffer his fate by stoning, paying the penalty for
his abuse with the bitter reproach of death.

[7.] Nevertheless, to give our lips full rein even while preserving
unimpaired our reverence for the highest Divinity. it astonishes me
(although in this matter Ι may be shamelessly stupid and foolish)
that the highest, pure, and absolute Goodness, the unfailing and
antonomastically majestic Spring and Source of mercy, should

the path of truth). it is not altogether consistent with the integrity of
reason that vengeance upon such slight and contemptible verbal
abuse and such cruel and inept summary judgment should be
credited to the Patron and Judge of the springs of highest and
purest pity and unending mercy, and the inexhaustible and infinite
fountain of commiseration, especially since it belongs to a demon
rather than the Deity to delight in shedding human blood.

[10.] To continue! it is common knowledge that after they had
travelled for three days from Mt. Sinai, the Israelite people were
