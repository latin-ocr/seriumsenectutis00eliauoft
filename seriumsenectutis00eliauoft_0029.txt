ELIAS AND THE ANTIQUARIANS 13

says: “For I scarce call ours ancestry and forefathers l Whom we
did not ourselves create.'' Thus he wamed them either to stop their
empty boasting of nobility or to display behavior consonant with
nobility, laudable actions and appropriate virtues. Otherwise they
would do better to call it fatuity rather than nobility. So along these
lines he published Contra nobilitatem inanem in one book.

He is reputed to have been still alive in AD 1280, when Edward
1 sat on the English royal throne.⁵⁸

Pits acknowledges Leland, which is to say Bale's Catalogus, as his source,
but he goes both Leland and Bale one better by making Bale's provisional
dating explicit (¹‘alive in AD 128o¹'), then treating it as an historical fact
worthy of elaboration (‘¹when Edward 1 sat on the English throne''). As
if to emphasize further the petrification of Bale's now traditional account,
Pits includes Elias in his index of Cambridge graduates.

Elias appears as one of relatively few Cambridge writers in Thomas
Fuller's History of the Worthies of England, a topographical collection
published after the author's death by his son.⁵⁹ Discussing his principles
for treating the writers of each county, Fuller prudently dismisses the
“trash'' Bale and Pits had included in their early centuries and proclaims
that he will begin with Gildas.⁶⁰ When he comes to Cambridgeshire and
Elias, Fuller cites Bale's Catalogus ‘'Cent. 4, Num. 48'' in his right margin
as authority for a by now familiar account:

HELIAS RUBEUS was born at *Thriplow in this County, bred
D. D. in Cambridge. Leland acquainteth us that he was a great Cour-
tier, and gracious with the King, not informing us what King it was,
nor what time he lived in,· onely we learn from him, that this Rubeus
(conceive his English Name Rouse, or Red) seeing many who were
Nobilitatis portenta (so that as in a Tympany their very greatness was
their Disease) boasted (if not causelessly) immoderately of their high

⁵⁹ Thomas Fuller, The History os the Worthies os Englan'd (Londonz 1. G. W. L. and W. G„
1662). 1 wish to thank J. M. Farrar, Cambridge County Archivist, for bringing Fuller to my
attention. Little could differ more from Bale's fervent commitment to religious reform and
dire fears for the survival of England's antiquities than Fuller's genial statement of his own
aims as author:

1 propoundfive ends to my self in this Book: First, To gain some Glory to God. Secondly,

To preserve the Memories os the Dead. Thirdly, To present Examples to the Living. Fourth-

ly, To entertain the Reader with delight. And lastly, (which 1 am not ashamed publickly

to profess) To procare some honest profit to my sels (1).

While one may wish that Bale had consulted his readers' delight at times, we are fortunate
indeed that, so far from seeking profit, he spared no expense in his antiquarian labors.
