led away by death to share extinction with their bodies, especially
since neither the supreme Power nor the benevolence of Nemesis
(the perseverance of the fates in which we glory) privileged man's
animal nature beyond other living creatures. Instead, they allowed
him to have his own unique gift like all other animals, a fact which

made more beautiful by the passage of time, without becoming
