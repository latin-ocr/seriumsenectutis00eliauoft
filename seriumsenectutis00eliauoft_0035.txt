found them and forwarded them to Flacius while he was revising the
Catalogus testium ueritatis around 1561.⁸⁴ Flacius may even have found
a copy of the Semidiales on the Continent in the aftermath of the dispersa]
of the English monastic libraries, although he writes to Parker that he is
unable to get about much himself in search of material. But my best
guess is that Bale found a manuscript of the Semidialae in England some·
time between the publication of the second part of the Catalogus 1559 and
his death in 1562 and relayed it or its contents to Flacius on the Conti-
nent.

Book One:

In a poem based on the hymn to Hymen which opens Martianus
Capella's Marriage ofMercury and Philology, Elias first sings of the marriage
bonds between pagan gods and goddesses, then laments human vice and

Cybele as the natural cycle which causes crops to grow (3), of Admetus
and Alcestis as mind and courage, and of Mercury and Philology as the
wise man's union of mind and tongue (4). He then praises the marriage

as saying one thing and meaning another (6). He ends by outlining God's
eternal punishment of lies (7).

Book Two:

The opening meter recapitulates Elias's notion that lies result
from a disassociation of mind and tongue (i). Philip objects that Elias is
a know-it-all (1). Philip knows of God's punishments for lies, even the
