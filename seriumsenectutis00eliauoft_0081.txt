BOOK Two 65

punished for murmuring about the hardship of their unending toils.
The absolute and unavoidable power of the Deity, which they had
willfully incited to wrath, pursued them with swift and terrible
vengeance, devouring the outermost part of the camp with divine
fire.

[11.] As a reminder, the power of Divinity exacted even more
terrible vengeance upon these people for later muttering. Their very
teeth dripping with quicksilver salivation for the meats and fish,
cucumbers and melons, onions and garlic by which they had been
satiated in Egypt, all the Israelites, both commoners and indiscrimi-
nate mob, did not hesitate to murmur against the highest excellence
of the supreme Deity. Foolishly scorning the manna, they corn-
plained of their dried-out souls and, sitting and weeping pathetical-
ly, ridiculously inclined themselves to concupiscence, rejecting the
rolls, ground finely and fried in pans, with a taste like oiled bread,
which had once pleased them. Moved by their unjust complaints,
the highest Goodness and benign Deity gave them as abundant
food not any flesh, but the great delicacy of quails ssying through
the air only two cubits off the ground and seemingly wishing to be
caught, and not for only one or two days, but for a month of days,
until it came out through the noses of those who devoured it and
nauseated them. But the Deity, who rarely leaves an offense unpun-
ished, was moved to wrathful fury against this people and struck
them with a deadly plague while they were still chewing like
concupiscent fools on the ample supplies of meat.

[12.] The divine power of God has inssicted punishment not just
on those who murmur against Him, but on those who verbally
abuse His followers. Those who read books and study tomes are
well acquainted, from the sober account of her brother, with the
sudden and fitting leprosy of Miriam, who murmured against
Moses, not to mention her penitential isolation outside the camp.

[13.] Nor, according to my judgment, are those who persevere in
their scholarly reading any less familiar with the scouts of the
Promised Land, sent by Moses to fulflll destiny, with the Israelites
who were moved to murmuring by their discouraging report, and
with God's inexorable verdict and execution of His fatal sentence.
