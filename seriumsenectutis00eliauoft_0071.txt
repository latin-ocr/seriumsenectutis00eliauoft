BOOK ONE 55

couple leads by a direct route to the tabernacle of the supreme
Governor and the infinite dwelling of incircumscribable Celsitude.
Certainly (to speak in well-known commonplaces which are tradi-
tionally on the tip of our tongue), the Church philosopher David
asserts that he who speaks the truth conceived by his heart not only
with his lips but in his mind will merit entry into the dwelling of
the unconstrained and judicious King, as long as he concerns
himself with justice, lives in innocence as a just man, banishes
trickery far from his tongue, and does not wrong or injure his
neighbor. Neither shall his hand be soiled by gifts, or his coffer reek
of vile usury, nor shall he be enveloped in vice by drink. Any man
who truly fears God is indeed glorious in true virtue.

[6.] Once these matters have been carefully weighed together or
severally, it becomes clear that anyone who imagines that the
author of the serious contracts or nuptial bonds we have just men-
tioned is worthy of censure, is himself barely distinguishable from
a raving lunatic. This is particularly true of what David says, since
that same philosopher—a man glorying in unalloyed truth—holds
that all who speak falsely, swear fraudulently, insinuate falsehoods,
or twist the truth to their own perverse ends, will perish by the
judgment of the preeminent and absolute Authority. A subtle
investigator might, if he wished, gather from the drift of these
words that not everyone who makes false assertions is always and
without further examination mendacious,· nor does anyone always
speak the whole truth. But, all things considered, he who speaks
contrary to his own mind is inevitably mendacious; he who without
reservation speaks the truth from a true heart will rightly be reck-
oned veracious.

[7.] According to the more explicit assertions of the same theolog-
ically philosophical adherent of the truth, anyone who willfully
refuses to prohibit his tongue from speaking evil or to circumcise
his lips so they do not speak trickery seems to want to have a
blameworthy life. Now that we have completed a sensible and
diligent analysis of my statements, it will be clear to any sensible
person that either it is not inordinately pernicious to the living to be
damned, and ruinous to the dead to suffer an eternity of punish-
ment, or it is useful and healthy for men who still draw breath to
marry mind with tongue in a firm union and to banish the entice-
ments of falsehood far from their lips and deceiving lies far from
