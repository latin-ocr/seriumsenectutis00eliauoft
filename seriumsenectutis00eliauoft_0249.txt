BOOK THREE 233

218 prehabita . . . pugna: The earlier battle was Marathon (490 Bc).

227-33 Sed . . . vniuersa: According to Justinus, this was on the fourth day of
fighting, after the Persians had occupied the heights above the pass.

249-50 dum . . . condiducunt: Cf. 228-29 above, which is closer to Justinus's
original (2.11.6 [31.26]); plura patrie quam vitae deberi.

25³ se proficisci: OLD offers no examples for reflexive forms of proficiscor.

275-86 justinus 2.12.8ff. (33 11ff.).

281-82 debitas . . . penas preinfligente: Again the divine causation is Elias's
addition to Justinus.

291-92 perniciter est pungnatum: Cf. Caesar, De bello Gallico 1.26.1 (ed. Du
Pontet), ”Ita ancipiti proelio diu atque acriter pugnatum est.''

292-342 Justinus 2.13.1ff. (35.1ff.). According to Justinus, the intimate (fami-
liaris) was Mardonius.

³03 parte: parte maiore would better suit Iustinus's account.

308 bellissime discretus . . . quidam: Sc. Themistocles, Justinus 2.13.6 (35.14).

335-37 dierum ingerebat: The sense in Justinus is rather different (2.13.12
[36.4-5]): “Multorum deinde dierum inopia contraxerat et pestem.‘' For dies as ¹'a
day's provision of food,'' see the index verborum.

343-53 Justinus 3.1.1ff. (39.1ff.).

343-44 It is Hercules, the implied subject of prosequeretur, who crowns Xerxes‘s
injustice with the murderous misdeed of Artabanus and not Xerxes himself.

349 Justinus gives the prefect's name as Artabanus.

354-80 Iustinus 20.2.3ff. (168.29ff.).

381-89 Valerius Maximus, Facta et dicta memorabilia 1.1.17 (ed. Kempf 9.11-20).

381-82 detracte religioni sue . . . perhibetur exegisse penam: 1t is tempting to emend
to religionis, which is in accord with classical usage and the reading in Valerius,
but the MS reading religioni is surely authorial and shows again the dative
encroaching on the genitive (see note to 2.89-90 above).

390-97 Valerius 1.1.1ss (9.21-24).

397 ut ... securus: Sc. esset.

398-408 Valerius 1.1.19 (10.1-13).

402 Doleret agrees with dolens in Kempf‘s deteriores and fills the lacuna in his
principal MSS.

403-4 manifestis . . . viribus: Here the divine causation is supplied by Valerius.

406-8 superstitibusque redintegraret: This passage was probably a crux in
Elias's MS of Valerius, as it is in ours. 1 take arbores superstites as the subject of
habueraant.

408 Redintegraret, while it may not be what Valerius wrote, makes better sense
than Kempf's dis multiplicauit or the other lectiones he supplies.

409-545 Justinus 24.1.8ff. (193.3ff.).

471 quod: Although Seel prints quid here, five of his MSS read quod.

482-84 Ioue . . . vindicta: Justinus (24.3.1o [195.4]) attributes vengeance on
Ptolemy to the diis immortalibus.

489-90 auguriis . . . premonstrantibus: “ducibus avibus,‘' Justinus 24.4.3 (196.13).

528-29 gallorum gloriandum: From Seneca, Apocolocyntosis 7.3 (ed. Eden,
40.2o-21), echoed by Petronius rediuiuus 100 (219). For the medieval circulation of
the Apocolocyntosis, see Eden's edition, 20-21, and L. D. Reynold's article in Texts
and Transmission, ed. L. D. Reynolds, 361-62. Colker, Analecta Dublinensia, 245,
notes that this saying is cited by William of Malmesbury and appears as entry
10154 in Hans Walther, Proverbia sententiaeque latinitatis Medii Aevi, 2:215. A pun
on the two senses of gallus (“rooste1‘' and “Gaul'') is intended in the Apocolocyn-
