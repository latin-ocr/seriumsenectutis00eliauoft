BOOKS SEVEN AND EIGHT 241

22-23 personis . . . comparatis: For unequal social status (conditio) as a ground for
annulment, see Peter bombard, Sententiae 4.30.1.1-2 (2.437-38) and 4.36.1-3

(ΖΞΞΞ-Ζξὲιὺιαε . . . commercium: Cf. the Lombard, Sententiae 4.27.3 (2.423.10-12),

quoting Chrysostom's Ser-mons on Matthew: “matrimonium quidem non facit
coitus, sed voluntas,'' and Iustinian, Codex 5.17.11 (ed. Krueger 2:213): “non enim
dotibus, sed adfectu matrimonia contrahuntur? On the relation of affection to
consent (6.39-44 and note), see John T. Noonan, Jr., “Marital Affection in the
Canonists.''

31 There seems to be a gap in the text here. Elias's opening paragraph on
marriage belongs with the full treatment of that topic in the preceding book,· of
the three stories he now tells to exemplify divine vengeance on human lies, two
(Battus and Mercury, and the scouts sent to the Promised Land) have already
been recounted by his interlocutor, Philip (cf. 3.29ff. and 2.181ff. above). In fact,
Elias does not so much retell the two tales here as allude to them while ex—
pounding their moral content.

³1 venerande vetustatis: Lucan 9.987, 10323.

35 ad restringendus mendaciorum laxitatis habenas: Cf. Vergil, Aeneis 12.499; Walter

12149, 18.113 (857, 877); John of Salisbury, Policraticus 725 (2.219.11-13), “Entheti-
cus in Policraticum'' 227; Geoffrey of Vinsauf, Poetria nova 111.

37-53 Ovid, Metamorphoses 2.680-707.

41 aratorque peronatus: Persius 5.102, cited by John of Salisbury, Policraticus 7,
prologue (2.91.12).

54—76 Nm. 13.

81-116 Dn. 13.

81-82 tam lippis eciam quam tonsoribus: see note to 385 above.

90 veraci vetustate: true (verax) inasmuch as this story comes from the Old

Testament rather than a pagan source.

(254).
Book Eight

46 anime de situ uel existencia: Although Philip promises to speak of the location
or existence of the soul, the passage from Macrobius which follows concerns its

nature or composition.
58-80 Macrobius, Commentarii in somnium Scipionis 1.14.19-20 (ed. Willis, 5830-

597Ξῖ78 Uirgilius . . . ymago: Elias's own addition to Macrobius¹s list, from Aeneis
6730 (with ymago for origo). ·

81-85 Verumptamen . . . consenciunt: Macrobius, Commentarii 1.14.20 (59.12-13).
The rather strange logic by which this claim about the philosophers' agreement
on the immortality and incorporeality of the soul follows immediately upon
claims that it is composed of blood, earth, fire and water is to be attributed to
Macrobius, although Elias accepts the juxtaposition without comment.

87-93 Cf. Vincent of Beauvais, Speculum naturale 23.62-74 (1695E-1703D).

94 Ramnusie: Nemesis was styled Rhamnusia or Rhamnusia virgo because she
was worshipped at Rhamnus in Attica (cf. Ovid, Metamorphoses 3.406).

96 Man's donum speciale is, as Philip announces in the next sentence, his
superior intelligence.
