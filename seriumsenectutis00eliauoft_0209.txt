BOOK TEN 193

ingly set aside his astonishment. Nevertheless, it was and perhaps
still is permissible to derive from such stories some hint or appear-
ance of truth for the immortality of the soul, especially since we
may be permitted to construe the unalloyed truth by means of less
certain truths.

[17.] Furthermore, to discover further allusions to this matter in
the opinions or explicit assertions of the most ancient writers,
Trismegistus, who is also called Hermes or Mercury, says while
talking familiarly with his Aesculapius: “My dear companion
Aesculapius, your ancestor, who in the guise of the sun is the first
inventor of medicine, to whom a temple is consecrated on the shore
of crocodiles and on the mountain of Libya where the earthly man
lies, that is, his body (the rest, or rather all, since the whole man
consiste in the sense of life, returned more fortunate to the sky),
even now by his godhead furnishes everything to sick humans
which he was aceustomed to accomplish with his art when alive.''
He openly leaves us to understand from his words that the human
soul is especially privileged with immortality.

[18.] The strongly espoused assertions of Seneca, a man of su-
preme subtlety and knowledge, concerning the excellence of the
first Scipio Africanus tend toward the same end. As was his custom,
this praiseworthy author writes about a man so worthy of commen-
dation in a letter to his friend Lucilius: “1 write these things to you
resting in the very villa of Scipio Africanus, having worshipped the
ashes and altar which Ι suspect to be the sepulchre of so great a
man. Ῑ am convinced that the great soul of the living man returned
to the sky whence it came, not because he led great armies, for the
madman Cambyses commanded them successfully in his madness,
but because of his exceptional moderation and sense of duty, which
1 admire in him more when he left his country than when he de-
fended it. Either Scipio had to forgo Rome or Rome liberty.'' Here
a great man speaking confidently of another great man clearly
leaves us to understand that he had no doubt that only those souls
infused in human bodies are privileged with immortality.

[19.] Since it concerns the present topic, let us from among innu—
merable arguments repeat in some measure the arguments and
proofs already adduced in public and confirmed in the undoubted
