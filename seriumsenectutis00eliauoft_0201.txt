BOOK TEN 185

true integrity was based on a firm foundation: to wit, the patriarchs
of Israel. According to my judgment, anyone should find it suffi-
cient proof of the immortality of the human soul that when a living
man has been killed by another man, the soul returns to revivify the
body which it previously animated, even after it has been despoiled
by the violence of death.

[5.] To speak of things that are public knowledge, Elijah, a man
who was alive with compassion for the living, was received quite
humanely as a humble guest by the lowly widow of Sarepta when
he was wearied by hunger and thirst. He begged her to give him a
pittance of water and bread or revive him with a tiny morsel, but
she did not at first heed his slight request. However, after the cruse,
with its unfailing supply of oil, and the meal in the jar strengthened
the faith of the woman as she gathered wood, this faithful and
complaisant widow was at length glad to oblige this noble and

widow, the widow's son died. (In this manner we may proceed to
our stated purpose.) But his intemperate mother ran about with her
thoughts in a frenzy, as if she were driven by furies, and raised a
clamor to the heavens. At length, the vehemence of her grief caused
her to turn upon her undeserving house guest: “What have I to do
with thee, thou man of God,'' she exclaimed as if driven insane,
“Are you not come to me, holy man, as to one who is unworthy, so
that by living with you as a sinner I should so sin that my son
should perish?''

[7.] But the man of God, subtly worried (as often happens) by the
widowed woman's distress, said in humble entreaty: “Give me thy
