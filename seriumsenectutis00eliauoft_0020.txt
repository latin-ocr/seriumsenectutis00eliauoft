4 INTRODUCTION

Admitting his uncertainty about Elias's dates, Bale places him between
two writers, Gilbert the Great and Walter the Hermit, who died within a
year or two of 1280.

If we take Bale at his word, we gain an appealing portrait of Elias as
man of virtue, polymath, theologian, and courtier. But, as Schmidt
remarks, Bale has merely piled moral commonplaces on top of the one
hard fact he found in Leland, namely, that the Contra inanem nobilitatem
of one Helias Rubeus Tripelaunensis was still to be found in a convent
near Cambridge.¹⁶ Furthermore, Bale makes no mention of Elias in his
two earlier catalogues of British writers, the chronological Summary of
Illustrious British Writers of 1548 and the alphabetical notebook, compiled
from 1548 to 1557 as Bale revised the Summary, which R. L. Poole has
published as the Index of British Writers.¹⁷ Nor does Elias appear in
either Bale's autograph epitome of Leland's De viris illustribus or the
“Regystre of the names of Englysh Wryters'' which Bale appended to his
edition of Leland's Laboryouse Journey.¹⁸ It is, in any case, disturbing to
notice that according to the Catalogus Bale had not seen the titles of Elias's
other works, as if that were all he had seen of the Contra nobilitatem. But
as Schmidt points out, Bale did at least interpret Elias's cognomen
correctly. The adjective Tripelaunensis, Tripolanensis, or Tripolawensis
denotes a native of Thriplow, a village eleven kilometers southwest of
Cambridge, and not of Tripoli in Outremer.¹⁹

The manor of Thriplow was held by the bishop of Ely from the cre-
ation of ¹that see in 1109 until 1600. There were several other manors in
Thriplow, including the rectory, which remained with the Ely priory after
1109 and was appropriated to the Pittancer, whence its name, the Pitten-
saries, or Pigeons.²⁰ British Library, MS Cotton Tiberius B. ii contains a

¹⁹ “Elias of Thriplow,'' 367. In English Friars, 218, Smalley suggests “Elias of Tripoli,¹' a
mistaken deduction she seems to have arrived at by incorrectly transcribing '‘tripolensis vel
tripolanensis'' in the Ringstede Commentary (MS Bodley 829, fol. 61⁹⁵, wrongly cited as
Lincoln College, MS latin 86, fol. 185¹b) as ‘'Tripolanitorum vel Tripolanensis'' (352).
