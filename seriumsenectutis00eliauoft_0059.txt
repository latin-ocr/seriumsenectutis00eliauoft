THE MANUSCRIPT 43

rum Angliae .. . (Oxford, 1697). The manuscript is also marked at the
bottom of fol. 1¹:

MS C 797
441 III-A

“MS C 797'' is the classification assigned to the manuscript by Sloane's
librarian J. G. Scheuchzer sometime between 1726 and his death in
1729.¹⁴¹ According to Scheuchzer's scheme, manuscripts were cata-
logued by size (A ⁸ folio, B = quarto, C = octavo) and number. ‘'441'' is
the number assigned to the manuscript when it was catalogued as part
of the Sloane collection in the British Museum. I am unable to determine
the significance of the marking III-A, which is in pencil and much later
than the other markings.

However, it is possible to discover the number assigned to the manu-
script when it entered Sloane's collection, although that number is not
visible on the manuscript in its current form. In Sloane's own main
catalogue of his manuscripts, now British Library, MS Sloane 3972C, our
manuscript appears in volume 1 (of eight) at the bottom of page CXCII
as MS C 797. This, again, is its classification according to Scheuchzer's
system, which is applied to each manuscript in the catalogue. Scheuch-
zer' s numbers are recorded on strips of paper which have been pasted
over the original margins, where the manuscripts were numbered accord-
ing to Sloane's original scheme. Although it is not possible to read the
original number of our manuscript, it is possible to read numbers for
manuscripts higher on the page and on the following page. By counting
forward or backward we discover that our manuscript was MS 506
according to Sloane's original classification when it entered his collection.

As Sloane 441 contains no other marks of provenance, I am unable to
trace its history from the time of its copying circa 1425 to it entry into
Sloane's library in 1698. But we might hazard a guess that its movement
from Brecon to London may have been facilitated by the Welsh book
collector Sir John Prise. Although Prise settled in Hereford and did most
of his collecting in western England, he was born in Brecon and retained
enough interest in that “natali quidem solo mihi charissimo'' to purchase
the priory there in 1542)ss It was in Brecon that Prise found his most
