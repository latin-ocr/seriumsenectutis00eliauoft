and made wiser by his subsequent punishment. For it is said that
after this outrageous misdeed he was never in his right mind or
fully in command of his faculties. He is said to have breathed his
last because of the great infirmity of spirit which resulted from
learning that one of his sons had died fighting in Illyria. Moved by

other transgressions. But if I am any sort of judge, these punish-
ments are not so intimidating as to pervert one's manner of speech,
erase the laws of analogical reason, vary the regular and approved
