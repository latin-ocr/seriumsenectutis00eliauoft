BALEUS AND FLACIUS 1 7

At this time, Flacius was busy collecting literary and historical writings
attacking the papacy and endorsing true religion for three collections, all
published at Basel, the first two by Oporinus: the Antilogia papae (1555),
Catalogus testium ueritatis (1556), and Varia . . . poemata (1557).⁷⁵ Bale him-
self was soon to publish his Catalogus (1557-59) with Oporinus; its ap-
pendices include a chronique scandaleuse of the papacy which Bale also
published separately as the Acta Romanorum pontificium in 1558.⁷⁶ In the
preface to the Acta, Bale names Flacius as one of his sources, and in a
letter of July 1560 to Archbishop Matthew Parker, Bale has cause to men-
tion

The newe ecclesiastycall hystorye, collected by Matthias Illyricus,

Joannes Wigandus and others, from whome 1 have receyued diverse
and many epistles, for helpe in the same.⁷⁷

Later in the same letter, Bale answers Parker's query about Protestant
church histories by recommending the papal history in his Catalogus and

ii other bokes lately set fourthe by me and Illyricus, the one is called
Catalogus testium veritatis, the other beareth this tyttle: Varia
doctorum piorumcgue virorum. Antilogia Papae, wyll also corre-
spond to the same. ⁸

became the Magdeburg Centuries (Baselz Oporinus‘ 1561-74), it is now clear that the text was
written by his coworkers at Magdeburg, Johann Wigand and Matthaus Judex. See Ronald
Ernst Diener, “'I'he Magdeburg Centuries: Α Bibliotheca! and Historiographical Analysis¹'
(D.Th. diss„ Harvard Divinity School, 1978).

⁷⁵ The full titles indicate the similarity of purpose among these collections. They are
Antilogia papae5 hoc est, de corrupto ecclesiae statu et totius cleri papistici perversitates scripta
aliquot veterum authorum ante annos plus minus CCC et interea; nunc primum in lucem eruta et
ab interitu vindicata (Baselz Oporinus, 1555), and Varia doctorum piorumque virorum de corrupto
ecclesiae statu poemata ante nostram aetatem conscripta: ex quibus multa historica quoque utiliter
ac summa cum voluptate cognosci possunt (Basek Lucius, 1557). For the Catalogus testium
ueritatis, see above, 15 n. 67.
