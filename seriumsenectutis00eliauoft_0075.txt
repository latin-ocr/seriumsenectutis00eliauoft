transgressions. I also know that Antiquity (which at least in this
respect clearly deserved to be ridiculed), languishing under ludi-
crous multitudes of deranged gods and their absurd fictional ex-

punished men for lies as well as transgressions and sins. Saving (as
behooves us) Antiquityâ€˜s reverence, the ancients betrayed their
ignorance in this affair, by showing themselves capable of believing

to understand that mercy will afflict those who lie in this manner
with the anguish of merited torment, lest some dishonest quibbler
turn the truth of what the lord God once said into the dissonance of
contrariety or vice. Indeed, although God may seem to men to
