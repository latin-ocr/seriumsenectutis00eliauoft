BOOK FOUR 125

spare any theologian for such pronouncements, not even Solomon,
with the wisdom of Solomon in his occult utterance. Instead, you
will immediately judge that his metaphors are vitiated by disso-
nance or clumsiness, or that inexorable contrariety or irreconcilable
opposition prevents harmony between the things he linked in
metaphor.

[7.] But leaving aside, or rather wholly obliterating the hasty
effrontery of your judgment, Solomon, a man of spiritual power
and wisdom, was not afraid to make the extravagant assertion that
the Church desired the kiss of the mouth of the spouse who had
often been promised her, the Lamb standing on the mount, so that
touched by the sweetness and harmony of the conjunction and

overflowing knowledge of supreme sanctity, are accustomed to
dismiss your error with serious and express discourse. Hence one
man drunk on the unfailing spring of the fountain of wisdom said,
as if alluding to the wise assertions of Solomon: ¹¹1 saw the holy city
Jerusalem descending' as a bride adorned with necklaces for her
husband.'' Alluding to other statements as though they were his
own! he spoke to the Bride in the same terms as she solemnly
