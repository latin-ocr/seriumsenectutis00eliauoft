THIS EDITION 45

meration are my own, as is capitalization, except at the beginning of
sentences or lines of verse. Texerii is quite scrupulous about marking
sentence divisions, and 1 follow him quite closely in this regard. Like
him, I accept as sentences clauses (perhaps authorial) which contain a
participle but no finite verb, or which begin with the construction gnarus
(ignarus, non bene gnarus) quod but lack a main verb.

Texerii paid close attention to establishing a hierarchy of punctuation
for his copy of the Ser-ium senectutis. He indicates minor medial pauses
with a punctus (.) and major medial pauses with a punctus elevatus (t),-
they correspond to the modern comma and colon or semicolon. He does
not employ a separate mark for questions. 1 have added brackets and
dashes to articulate the structure, or at times lack of structure, of Elias's
longer periods. Otherwise, encouraged by Peter Dronke's practice in his
edition of Bernardus Silvestris's Cosmographia, I have tried to punctuate
Elias's Latin as if it were modern English. In practical terms this means
that I have punctuated for breath pauses as well as logical articulation or
subordination.

Orthography follows Sloane 441. It shows usual medieval variations
such as ily, ile, dlt, doubling of consonants, addition or elimination of h,
assimilation and dissimilation of consonants. For the most part Texerii
distinguishes graphically between c and t, u and v, but then uses them
rather interchangeably. 1 silently expand 9 and ῖ before p as com· and
im-, which are the forms Texerii prefers when spelling them out.
However, 1 retain con· and in· when they are Texerii's actual spellings. By
the same principle, I expand Tm· as inm-. Michi and sed are Texerii's
spellings. Although Texerii clearly distinguishes between circa (σε’) and
citra (άέ’), a glimpse at the apparatus will show that they are often
confused. Presumably, a scribe earlier in the chain of transmission
abbreviated both as σε’. In the case of ambiguous abbreviations (nichillnil,
specialislspiri tual is) 1 have been guided by context, although this has rarely
been unambiguous in the case of the latter.

The most unusual spellings here, saguis and ligua, are consistent but
probably scribal. Indeed, Texerii's treatment of nasals is somewhat
idiosyncratic. He adds nasal consonants to pungnatum (3292) and pungna
(4.199). He transposes them twice in antimonias (8.48, 52 var.; cf. also
anamolumque, 4356). He begins to write segnificare (8.14) as seni-. And,
while these are probably no more than slips of the pen, we might note
the spellings Nuquid (132 var.) and sollepnitates (224 var.). Texerii also

sections either for their own edification or for material they could easily use in their own
writing or speaking. Ringstede quarried exempla in this manner from the De vita scolarium
for his Commentary on Proverbs.
