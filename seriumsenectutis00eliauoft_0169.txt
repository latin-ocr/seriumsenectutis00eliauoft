BOOK SIX 153

promulgation of the new law it has been a point of recourse that the
marriage due (that is, a gift on account of nuptials) is a special
contract which requires no report as follow-up, although it be from
another man in the groom's name, provided that the husband signs
for it as if he had given it.

[3.] According to the general practice of the law, even if the
documents concerning a gift or dowry for an upcoming wedding
are lacking, or the banquet or any other ceremony is omitted, no
one may conclude from this that an otherwise correctly celebrated
marriage lacks a firm foundation, or that for such a reason the laws
governing free men can be speciously denied the children born
from it. Indeed, as long as no law presents an obstacle to the har-
monious partnership established in moral rectitude by their consent
and the faith of their souls, that partnership will always remain in
accord with the marriage contract, and no condition or stipulated
time will be able to affect the perpetual nuptials of those joined in
marriage. The rule of law, which is hardly variable or a plaything
of time, does not allow conditions and stipulated times to affect the
solid persistence of legitimate marriage contracts. Indeed, contracts
are hardly to be limited by a day or condition. It was and is a
regular confirmation of an established purpose that legitimate
contracts boldly exclude all stipulated times and conditions, so
much so that they are utterly vitiated by any stipulation of time or
condition. However, as the jurist says, those principles which
customarily expose a defect when understood more openly some-
times tacitly allow exceptions for certain forms of behavior.

[4.] For if a man who is bound by a contract is immediately
released from it because he agreed conditionally, such a release will
seem to stipulate something only if there is a condition of prior
obligation which, if explicitly provided for, would make the result
of the donor's intention worthless to the recipient. What the jurist
says elsewhere at another time seems to suffice nearly enough for
this matter. He writes: ยนยน1 give him Stichus if he wishes: such a
bequest, made in this manner, is reckoned to be conditional and is
not transferable to an heir unless the legatee so wishes, even though
otherwise what was bequeathed without such an addition is trans-
ferred to the legatee's heir.'' For in law it is one thing if something
is contained tacitly, another if it is stated explicitly in words.
