RECONSTRUCTING A LIFE 11

Canterbury.⁵² No wonder then that sometimes Bale could hope to do no
more than record titles, dates, and incipits. Describing the research he
undertook after he set about revising the Summarium in 1549, Bale writes
that between visits to libraries in Oxford, Cambridge, London, and

Norwich,

Among the stacyoners and boke binders, Ι found many notable
Antiquitees, of whom Ι wrote out the tytles, tymes and begyn-
nynges, that we myghte at the leaste shetoe the names of them, though
we have not as now, their whole workes to shewe (my italics).⁵³

Bale did, after all, record Elias's full name and interpret his cognomen
correctly. Nor can I claim that my attempt to locate Elias in the daily and
learned life of Cambridge and Ely by means of a few scattered hints and
documents is altogether different in kind from Bale‘s account of a career
at Cambridge and court which squared with the one piece of evidence he
possessed.

What sort of life, then, have we reconstructed for Helias Rubeus
Tripolanensis? He held a small parcel of land and was styled “master'' in
the survey of 1222; he was dead by 1251. He taught school for at least
part of his career. Elias would not have been licensed master in arts
before the customary age of twenty-one; nor, as is more likely, would he
have completed a partial course of university study and assumed control
of a classroom containing up to sixty or one hundred students at a
younger age.⁵⁵ Dating back from 1222, Elias was born before 1200,
perhaps as early as 1180-1190. He wrote at least four works, one of
which, the Serium senectutis, survives intact and contains material, drawn
from the new Aristotle, which was the basis for study in the arts at
universities by mid-century but was little known before 1220-1230. So we
should date Elias's death closer to 1251 than 1222, perhaps circa 1240-
1250, and even speculate that Elias returned to his studies, perhaps by

⁵⁴ lt remains just possible that Bale had seen more about Elias in ueland¹s literary
remains than the Bamwell entry, since some of beland‘s material was lost within ten or
fifteen years of his death in 1552—long enough for Bale to have had a look before it
perished.
