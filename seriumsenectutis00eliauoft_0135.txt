consistent with delight or rather a sport conducive to profit. In
Antiquity, which is always to be revered by rightful necessity, the
poets, devoted to unwearied studies, sought to perpetuate their
pages by writing only what caused delight or profit, so that they
might obtain for themselves perpetual fame, immortal praise, and
the sweet increase of poignant rewards.

BOOK FOUR

He who does what many others like him do

In similar situations will seem absurd to few;
If he wishes to be dissimilar to a fellow like himself,

He will be contemptible to many for living the low life.
Anyone who spurns the methods of those like him

Or better at his craft is hardly well taught;
Any wise man who loves his calling follows the best
In his field unless he loves it in bad faith.

So banish your circumlocutions and words
Inconsistent with customary usage and measure,-

For whoever chooses new measure and usage for himself
Will seem respectable to almost no one.

[1.] After my companion had poured forth these words at such
length, as if he were party to some conflict or dispute, 1 chose to
pay him back with equally harsh terms of disagreement: Truly, my
friend, it astonishes me beyond the bounds of customary measure
that you should act so obstinately rash and deluded. That a mortal
should sometimes be deluded is no cause for surprise or consterna-
tion, for there is nothing, or practically nothing, to be found in
human inventions or affairs which is perfectly achieved in all its
parts. But 1 imagine it will utterly astonish any wise person that a
fool of his own volition constantly seeks to wallow in the slough of
his impetuosity.
