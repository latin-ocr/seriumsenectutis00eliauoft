234 COMMENTARY

tosis and Serium senectutis but not in the other works, which would suggest that
Elias knew Seneca's work directly.

546-673 Justinus 24.6.1ff. (197.3ff.).

550-51 Dux . . . Brennius: According to Iustinus, Brennus was in Greece while
the Gauls under Belgius defeated Ptolemy. He led a successful raid on Macedonia
in an attempt to win himself a share of the booty from the prior engagement.
Elias conflates Belgius and Brennus so as to tighten the chain of human transgres-
sion and divine vengeance which binds together Ptolemy and Belgius-Brennus.

563-65 Est . . . conueniunt: Elias probably worked from a MS of lustinus which
was defective at this point. 'I'he full text of Iustinus reads: “Templum autem
Apollinis Delphis positum est in monte Parnasso, in rupe undique inpendente: ibi
civitatem frequentia hominum fecit, qui admiratione maiestatis undique concur-
rentes in eo saxo consedere.'' But “inpendente . . . undique'' are omitted by Seel's
MSS groups τ and ι (11 of 19 MSS).

572 solus acciderit aduenticius: Seel's reading which he bases on MSS classes τ
and ι, makes better sense: “accedit tubarum sonus.¹' But he cites a variant
“accidit turbarum sonus'' from his C ( Β Laurentianus 66, 21) which points us in
the direction of Elias's lone wanderer.

591-92 ducibus . .. duobus: Justinus gives the names of the two partners as
Aenianus and Thessalorus.

594 The delay in question was to have lasted for one night: ”Igitur Brennus
cum in conspectu haberet templum, diu deliberavit, an confestim rem adgrede-
retur an vero fessis via militibus noctis spatium ad resumendas vires daref'
(Justinus 24.7.1 [198.15-18]).

617 verpo: that is, his middle finger. See Huguccio, Magnae derivationes, s.v.
digitus: “Tertius [digitus] medius uel impudicus, quia per eum probri insectatio
exprimitur. Idem et uerpus a uerrendo podicem. Percussit enim [Deus] ludeos in
posteriora et obprobrium sempiternum dedit eis. Nam singulis annis in crucifixi-
one Domini emittunt sanguinem per posteriora, que cum medio reponunt et
[uerrunt] eo digito podicem. Et inde uerpus dictus est quasi [uerrens] podicem.
Vnde ille digitus adhuc ostenditur obprobrium in Iudeis, quoniam si ali[c]ui
ludeo ostenderis nunquam te postea diliget. Hinc quenalis: medium quia
ostendere unguem. Hoc faciebat Democritus [fortuneh scilicet pretendebat ei
medium digitum in obprobrium, sicut fit 1ude[i]s, per hoc eam contemptibilem
esse ostendit. Et hinc est quod uerpus inuenitur pro ludeo, uidelicet quenalis:
quod si cum est ad fontem soles deducere uerpos, id est Iudeos glosandum est¹'
(p. 113). Cf. the identical account in Balbus, Catholicon, s.v. Why Elias attributes
such a gesture to Brennus is not clear. Perhaps he means to suggest no more than
a generalized obscenity.

674-92 Valerius 1.1.20 (10.14-11.8).

684-86 Quin . . . recepisset: According to Valerius, at the same time as he learned
of one son's death, Fulvius learned that the other had been severely injured:
“alterum decessisse, alterum grauiter audisset adfectum¹¹ (120 [1020-211).

693-705 Valerius 1.1.ex.1 (11.9-17).

713 censende: The various punishments of the two previous sentences (penali-
tates . . . puniciones . . . vindictas ulci'cmumve varietates) serve as implied subject here.

715-18 contumaciter . . . officiis: The severe ellipsis which makes the syntax if not
the sense of this passage difficult to follow is unusual, since Elias elsewhere bases
his style on consistent elaboration. Texerii treats 716-18 (res . . . officiis) as a
separate sentence, but its infinitive verbs (coniungere . . . addicere) are dependent
upon valeant (714).
