BOOK EIGHT 165

contrary to all reason and unsupported by proof betrays his utter
foolishness, especially when what he tries to establish by verbal fiat
is not an axiom or premise of a discipline, or does not serve as a
preliminary postulate to any body of knowledge. Indeed, the man
who tries to assert that among so many living organisms only the
soul of man is endowed with immortality, and that of all things

ridiculous raving, especially since he is not supported by any
reason which is fundamentally sound, superficially probable, or

[2.] By now, the learned are familiar with, even bored by, the
divergent opinions and various thoughts concerning the definition
or description of the human soul in the writings of eminent philoso-

each other about the soul's substance. All this suggests falsehood or
mendacity and implies an error of presumption in those who
willingly oppose each other. So, in order to assume only common
knowledge and avoid any false assertion, 1 will state the opinions of
the various philosophers concerning the location or existence of the
soul, and the various causes which have nursed contention and
strife. In fact, claims which give rise to antinomies and supply
matter for disputes are rarely found to be true or epistemologically
certain. The ancients, men who were philosophically sophisticated,
were wholly unable to agree among themselves in splendid harmo-
ny either on the definition or innate composition of the soul, and so
set aside all antinomies and contradictory deductions So it is
scarcely to be hoped that the moderns' supine simplicity and igno-
rance should be able to achieve a perfect definition or innate cogni-
zance of the soul. You might consider, if you like, the various
