several compositions to him. Moreover, Bale mentions him in his
catalogue of writers.⁶⁹

Bale's guess that Elias died about 1280 could easily have suggested
Flacius's claim that he wrote the Semidiales about three hundred years
before the publication of the Catalogus testium ueritatis, that is, around
1262. Both writers attempt only approximate dates for Elias,· Flacius could
have come by his simply by counting back a plausible amount from the
date for Elias's death implied by Bale. Since we have already seen how
Pits and Tanner made explicit and propagated Bale's florui t 1280 for Elias,
it should come as no surprise that Flacius's approximate dating of the
Semidiales was in turn accepted as definitive by Continental scholars,
beginning with Wolfius.⁷⁰ Flacius agrees with Bale that Elias was the
author of several works: “although this writer has not been printed we
attribute several compositions to him.''⁷¹

But Flacius's knowledge of the entry for Elias in Bale's Catalogus does
not go far towards explaining how he acquired a manuscript of the
Semidiales. In fact, there is abundant evidence that Bale and Flacius had
known each other since at least 1554, when Flacius wrote Bale from
Magdeburg on 1 July.⁷² From the tone and contents of that letter—
Clarissimo viro Ioanni Baleo doctori et episcopo—it is clear that Flacius and
Bale had already made contact, probably some time after Bale's arrival in
the Netherlands in November 1553 as a Marian exile.⁷³ Among other
matters, Flacius offers to see Bale's enlarged Catalogus and Leland (pre-
sumably the collectanea or De viris illustribus) through the press at Witten-
burg or Leipzig. He then implores Bale to help with his Magdeburg
Cen turies, the first Protestant history of the church, and ends by greeting
a common friend.⁷⁴¹

“as a kind of handbook of Protestant church history'' (ibid), we may prefer them to

certain other works of which, however, 1 have not thus far seen the titles¹' (my italics).
English antiquaries from Pits on make no mention of the possibility that Elias wrote works
other than Contra nobilitatem inanem.

to become their pastor. See Christina Hallowell Garrett, 'l'lie Marian Exiles: Α Study in the
