doubt that noteworthy speeches sensibly leave something for us to
understand. Indeed, the power of true virtue will fill them with
bread, wine, and oil produced by the earth. But not all the trees of
the field and cedars of Libanus will be filled, only those which the
power of the divine godhead planted in faith. First, the trees of the
field will be filled, that is, the common people and the low-born,·

bound or married by reciprocal bonds, as long as you stupidly
insisted upon considering only the surface of statements of this

[17.] If you could think clearly and sensibly, you would consider
worth investigating finely beforehand or understanding in a hidden
sense anything which superficially ought to be removed as a flaw.
Hymen, the natural affection or love of all things, the concord and
vitality of nature by which all creatures and *all elements exist, is
said to bind the elements reciprocally, that is, alternately or by
