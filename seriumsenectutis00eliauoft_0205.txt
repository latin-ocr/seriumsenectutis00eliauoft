BOOK TEN 189

whether this worthy woman desired for herself anything that he
could worthily accomplish in the name of repayment. Moved at
length by the persuasion of the messenger sent to her, the generous
woman did not hesitate to ask him for offspring of her own, be-
cause (as often happens) she was afflicted by sterility and reckoned
that she would always lack offspring, especially since her husband
had already reached a ripe old age. Elisha said to her: “At this time
next year you will have born a son to your husband.'' Nor, as it
turned out, did he deceive her by making such a promise, but at
that exact time and day she was delighted by the birth of a son,
from then on her husband was greatly delighted by their son as he
started to crawl, was weaned, began to ask questions, and walk.

[11.] But death soon dispelled her newly conceived joy in her
recent offspring, for the delicate boy was easily exhausted by a
fever and departed from this sublunar world, relinquishing life with
fatal ease. Then this mother, inconsolably dismayed and raving
wildly as women will, sought to find solace for her sorrow. She
finally sought as intercessor for her lost offspring the man whose
aid she had welcomed in the absence of progeny. The mournful
matron prepared to visit him as he resided on Mount Carmel;

from among the sons of Israel in order to consign him to his last
rites, when they saw in their path roving brigands attacking Israel,
thirsting rapaciously for spoils and the blood of the Israelites.
Stricken with unsettling fear by this unusual event and reluctant to
go any further, they put the body of the dead man in Elisha's
sepulchre, so as to flee swiftly and without encumbrance. But when
the dead body touched those holy bones, it came to life and walked
away by the powerful virtue of one already buried. Reinvigorated
by the divine power of the dead man and revivified by the soul
which he had previously discharged, he spurned the prison of the
grave and walked away in delight with a lively gait, congratulating
himself on being alive again to carouse with his companions.
