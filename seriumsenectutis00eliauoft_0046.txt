30 INTRODUCTION

As Ῑ now see for the first time as a result of your edifying discourse,
no man who breathes under the sun can love virtue or worship the
true godhead purely, unless he constantly praises this matrimonial
contract with unchanging will and true emotion (12.69-77).

But to get as far as Elias's proofs for God's omnipotence we must consid-
er his debt to Boethius. Like Bernardus Silvestris and Alan of Lille in the
twelfth century, Elias follows Boethius in maintaining a regular alterna-
tion between verse and prose. But Elias is unable to rival Boethius's
metrical dexterity, so he sticks to the hexameters and elegiae couplets he
would have known best. Nor can Elias rival the complex counterpoint of
theme and image summarized and anticipated which Boethius achieves
in his meters. Elias may place his meters at the beginnings of books, but
they serve almost solely to recapitulate earlier themes in abstract and not
always memorable moral terms. Like Boethius, Elias organized his satire
as a dialogue, but he gives himself the better part of the argument, rather
as if Boethius had written the Consolation from Philosophy's point of
view. Anna Crabbe has written well of the process of Platonic anamnesis
by which Boethius achieves his reconversion to a properly philosophie
attitude towards misfortune.¹⁰² There is no such process here: Philip
functions rather baldly as a pupil to be educated, even a straight man to
draw out Elias's best lines, before capitulating quite suddenly at the end.

But the overall movement of the two works is unmistakably similar. In
working out his dialectic with Lady Philosophy, Boethius moves from a
solipsistic imprisonment in error to an awareness of his freedom to act in
the sight of God. Elias's implied dialectic starts from Philip's stories of
human impiety and misplaced belief in a plurality of gods, and ends
with Elias's proofs of the immortality of the soul and the unique oneness
of the Trinity. Philosophy's shift from lighter to stronger medicines finds
its echo in Elias's switch from figurative language to the technical terms
of canon law and scholastic philosophy midway through the Serium
senectutis. The similarity of their ends clinches the resemblance between
the two works. Book 5 of the Consolation is Boethius's creative reworking
of the whole body of thought surrounding Aristotle's discussion of future
contingents in chapter 9 of De interpretatione. No work is more important
to our understanding of this book than Boethius's own commentary on
the De interpretatione.¹⁰³ Elias uses several proofs to establish God's
