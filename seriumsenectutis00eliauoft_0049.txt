ary developments, the compilatio.¹¹³ As we have seen in surveying the
work's contents, Elias justifies his use of other men's arguments for the
existence of one God by claiming to have embellished them stylistically.
He might also have defended his procedure by pointing out that he had
done his readers a service by assembling excerpts from such a wide
range of sources under clearly defined moral headings. Ringstede found
the historical material assembled in the lost Con tra nobilitatem inanem and
De vita scolarium a useful source of classical material for his Wisdom com-
mentary. But Parkes reminds us that compilatio served “both as a form of
writing and as a means of making material easily accessible.''¹¹⁴ Compi-
lation was Elias's method for composing a Menippean satire.

8. Language and Style

The Serium senectutis contains fifteen metra or verse passages: one
at the beginning of each book, with an extra metrum in both the first and
last books. The longest meters are those which begin and end the work,-
they are each twenty-eight lines in length. The shortest meter is the
second one in book 1. which is four lines in length. Besides the latter! the
work contains seven meters which are between twelve and sixteen lines
long, and seven meters which are between twenty-two and twenty-eight
lines long. Nine meters (numbers 1-6, 8-9) are written in elegiae couplets]
while six (numbers 7, 10-13.2) are written in hexameters. It is worth
noting these formal symmetries at the outset, because these fifteen meters
may be a conspicuous element in the work's form, but they have little
effect on its deeper structure. Elias was, at heart, a writer of prose.

In downplaying the importance of verse in his prosimetrum' Elias
followed the lead of Martianus Capella. Here we will find none of the
metric virtuosity of Boethius or Alan of Lille. none of their complex
interplay between language' image, and argument. Once his work is
underway, Elias uses his meters strictly to summarize points already
made in the discursive prose passages. As we have seen, he restricts
himself to elegiae couplets and hexameters. One might glorify this as a
classicizer's conscious rejection of accentual meters, but it would be safer
to see here a prudent resolve on Elias's part to stick to the two meters he
