At the same time, Joshua, son of Nun, and Caleph, son of Iephone,
who had scouted the land with the others, earned the grace of the
free and absolutely unconstrained Judge by rending their garments
and mollifying the murmurs of the populace. By virtue of such
perennia] grace they lived to see the life without end of the Prom-
ised Land, and the beautiful and fruitful plain which the Lord had
promised. Because the other scouts felt free to disparage the Prom-
ised Land with vile falsehoods when they returned to camp, they
were buried in the desert, fulfilling their sentence according to
God's purpose and the spoken judgment of all. Unaware that it is
pathetically ridiculous for any army to earn itself eternal loss solely
by telling superfluous lies which redound to its own harm, they
were rightfully damned for their garrulity and great discharge of
lies, excluded from their longed for share of the divine promise,
and deprived of any part in it.

[14.] According to a proverb long since trivial and trite but still
on everyone's lips, anyone who presumes to invent criticism of
some food or drink, or does not blush to censure it in all serious-
ness, or disdain it with countenance or gesture, is unworthy to
enjoy it. Indeed, by the very act of criticizing or making faces at the
food placed before him, he ridiculously debars himself from its use
or consumption. It seems manifestly equitable that by their false
vituperation of God's bountiful promise, these rash liars should
have wholly excluded themselves from the precious promise of
such a precious Promiser. Thus, the sentence of this sensible judge
is also, according to my conjecture, supported by a stable base of
reason and equity. Nevertheless, there is no place for conjecture in
the tribunal of the altogether free Judge, nor for presumption or
corollary allegation, nor for extrinsic logie or adventitious equity,
nor the pimping of injustices, contumelies or favors, nor the reme-
dies of refutation or appeal, albeit pure, humble, and earnest suppli-
cation finds a place there.
