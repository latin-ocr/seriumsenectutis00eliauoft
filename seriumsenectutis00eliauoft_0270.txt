A second group of corrections not recorded in the apparatus has been made
with a thin pen in a fluent hand here denoted by the siglum 5¹. It is almost
certainly Texerii's. Additions are by superscription and are usually marked by a
caret. Deletions are marked by a slash, underlined, or crossed out. Corrections are
by expunctuation and superscription. While these changes generally appear to
have been made at the proofreading stage, some (e.g., that recorded at 9.49
below) may have been made during copying. At 7.91, S¹ corrects wlgata to
diwlgata before the corrected word is deleted by Texerii as he copies the text.
Here, a't least, we have a correction by 5ι which was almost surely executed
during copying rather than proofreading. 1.84 8¹ ad. et, 2174 S¹ ad. sed, 2.282

Another group of corrections, marked with the siglum 5⁶, is by superscription
and shows evidence of careful reading of Texerii's text. However, there is no
compelling reason to think that these corrections arise from a comparison of the
Sloane manuscript with another copy of the Serium senectutis. A number of these
corrections (e.g., those recorded for 4.2, 4.176, and 10.46 below) are in a small,
neat hand which closely resembles Texerii's. Others (e.g., 2322) are in a shaky
hand which does not. But Ι have not felt able to distinguish in every case between
hands and have felt the less need to do so as most of these corrections are
obvious and could have been supplied by any perceptive reader. Here it is only
necessary to note the readings in Texerii's original hand which have been
replaced by corrections in this group. 1.69 sinceritate S, 23 loquenda S, 2.70
