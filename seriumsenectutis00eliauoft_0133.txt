usages of speech, conjoin contraries, or perversely assign things to
functions for which they are fundamentally unsuited. Anyone who
prefers to declare his intent with unusual circumlocutions and
verbal ingenuities fetched from ridiculously remote foreign realms,
when he is capable of saying appositely what he intends to argue in
accord with proper speech and universal custom, reveals his ridicu-
lous ignorance and moral or intellectual perversity.

[46.] Any sensible judge will agree that one who chooses to make
his way along the twists and turns of byways when he might
instead step smartly down the middle of a public or military street
or the level plain of a local path deviates derisibly from the way of
discretion. But pray tell what yoking of things, conjunction or bond,
especially in the form of matrimonial sodality, is more ridiculously
remote from the integrity of reason than the ill-joined and funda-
mentally awkward nuptial association of tongue and mind? What
could be more inconsistent, even in the very utterance of the spoken
word, than for the tongue and mind to turn in unison to marital
desires? Indeed, it only rarely happens that one thing is suited to
another without the converse being true. Neither tongue nor mind
could fittingly agree to matrimonial vows, since they always show
themselves utterly opposed and in total disagreement, even if they
both struggle to resist marriage vows. It is almost impossible to find
an example of stable agreement between contraries (or things
inexorably opposed) and their antitheses (or rather opposites).

[47.] Fired by such rash frivolities and obstinate in your igno-
rance, brother, you should abstain from scurrilities and stop slan-
dering the customary usages of speaking or living. And if, accord-
ing to long custom, a sharp pang moves you to write something,
you should respond by banishing all trifles from mind and hand,
lest hand and mind pause more than they should over your lan-
guishing and boorish pen, and write with apposite pen something
