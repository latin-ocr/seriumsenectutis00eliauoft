BOOK NINE 177

basely worthily avows that an ox is its god, since by avowing
themselves inferior to an ox they seem in consequence to be judged
by their own judgment.

[6.] Certainly no knowledgeable person should avow himself to
be better endowed than his god with knowledge, power, or mental
acuity. In fact, if you put any faith in my account, the man who is
capable of bowing down and humbly supplicating a god far inferior
to himself in both power and knowledge hardly differs from a

subjugation, not only shaped by hand fictive gods for itself, but also
established monsters naturally abhorrent to humanity as gods at
once worthy of worship and fatally poisonous. Under them the
