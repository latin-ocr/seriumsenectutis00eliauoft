greatly perplexed by what I had said: Is it possible, Elias, that aster
all these years you have been reduced to such mental vacuity that
you continue to babble even when asleep and snoring with wakeful

statesman by scarce unseasonable reckonings, and measure the
quinquennial progression of the years by the wrinkles on face and

deduce that either innate lasciviousness pricks you on, old man, or
lawful concupiscence moves you out of season. It is a well-known
fact that the avaricious man talks constantly about the gold he
covets, that the absurd poseur boasts of non-existent estates and
imaginary wealth, and that the effeminate man who is a wanton
prisoner of sex lisps of amorous wives and mistresses. And, in
general, a man's tongue often speaks of that which his mind pon-
ders, and what he wants is on his lips.
