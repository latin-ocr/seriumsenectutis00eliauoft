LANGUAGE AND STYLE 37

same event several times in telling any given story. Leonidas occupies
the pass at Tbermopylae twice within ten lines (3.215-17, 224-27). Elias
even tells several stories, most notably the story of Mercury and Battus,
more than once.

Elias has two fairly distinct prose styles. He uses his more ornate style
in the bridge passages at the beginning and end of books, where he and
Philip exchange charges and counter charges, introduce and summarize
their arguments, or effect transitions from one stage of an argument to
another.¹²¹ Besides the meters, these are about the only passages in the
Serium senectutis which are not written from any outside sources, and so
they may be called exercises in free composition. These passages are
often difficult to understand, and their sense can at times be inferred
only from the discursive arguments which lead up to or flow out of
them. Elias uses his relatively straightforward style for narration, espe-
cially for the many exempla he has drawn from Old Testament and
classical sources. Elias does not hesitate to recast even his biblical stories
in this relatively plain style, which is, in fact, far more ornate than
Jerome's biblical Latin. This makes his unwillingness to alter the style of
Valerius Maximus all the more remarkable. In fact, Valerius was proba-
bly one of the primary models for this plain narrative style, as Martianus
Capella was for the difficult style of the reflective passages.

We can best see how ornate even this plain style is if we compare
Elias's description of the temple at Delphi with its source in Iustinus.
According to Justinus,

Templum autem Apollinis Delphis positum est in monte Parnasso,
in rupe undique concurrentes in eo saxo consedere. Atque ita tem-
plum et civitatem non muri, sed praecipitia, nec manu facta, sed
naturalia praesidia defendunt, prorsus ut incertum sit, utrum muni·
mentum loci an maiestas dei plus hic admirationis habeat. Media
saxi rupes in formam theatri recessit. Quamobrem et hominum
clamor et si quando accidit turbarum sonus, personantibus et reso-
nantibus inter se rupibus multiplex audiri ampliorque quam editur
resonare solet. Quae res maiorem maiestatis terrorem ignaris rei et
admirationem stupentibus plerumque adfert.¹²²

¹²¹ R. W. Hunt draws attention to similar ''highssown language'' in the transitional
passages of works by the fourteenth-century Oxford grammarian Richard of Hambury. See
“Oxford Grammar Masters in the Middle Ages,'' in The History os Grammar in the Middle
Ages, 177.

match the text Elias used.
