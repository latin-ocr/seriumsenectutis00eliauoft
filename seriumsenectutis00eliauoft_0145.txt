BOOK FOUR 129

hasty speech of one who is lacking in circumspection and, as any-
one would agree, is far removed from sensible discretion or con-
stancy, who says things he has not thought out beforehand. He
clearly reckons that without forethought the operation of tongue or
mouth is very sensibly decreed to be judged to be absurd. Thus he
agrees with Solomon, who claims in a commendable metaphor that
the fool‘s heart is in his mouth.

[12] Furthermore, it is typical of those who loosen their lips so
inordinately that if they are unable to achieve the outcome they
desire, they still speak evil, and even if they are unable to speak
evil, they manage to contaminate their thoughts with depravity, so
that even when nothing evil is at hand, it is not absent from heart
or mind. In what follows, he announces what such a person pur-
sues to the best of his ability: “As a sharp razor thou hast wrought
deceit,'' that is, swiftly, as a sharp razor shaves quickly and with
ease. 'I'hen follows: “And my tongue shall meditate thy justice, thy
praise all the day long.'' Here he would seem to attribute inappo-
sitely to the tongue the abilities of heart or mind, were it not that
(as we read in preeminently Sacred Scripture and find approved by
the Sacred Page) the voice of a man speaking in this manner ac-
cords so well with the heart of Christ that the abilities of the heart
may be attributed to the mouth. His tongue is said to have meditat-
ed justice in preaching a saving God and the New Testament.

[13.] He adds: “The mouth of the just shall meditate wisdom'',·
that is, it articulates sensibly premeditated instruction for the good
of others. Such a sensible understanding of this statement, which
superficially attributes the mind's properties to the mouth, effaces
what seemed a tlaw in the superficial sense. This comes later: “My
protector and the horn of my salvation''; that is, unyielding height
of my salvation. This interpretation banishes the discord of a
horned salvation. N ext follows: “God hath girt me with strength for
battle,'' lest the ssesh's shifting or dissolute desires impede me in
the hard-fought battle against the vices. The buckling of a useless
and incomprehensible belt is fitly canceled or expunctuated by the
harmony of these words held suspect more than was just by the
rash, as if discordant or inconsistent with virtue.
