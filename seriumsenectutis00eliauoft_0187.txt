stepchildren to old age. But among animals only men remain
without the slightest delights: birds can stroll upon solid ground
when they please, delight in land and sea, and lift themselves into
the air with outstretched wings: man, on the other hand, makes his
way only on solid ground with slow and weary steps.

[7.] Α sensible man should not foolishly flatter himself, nor
should human frailty be so stupidly proud as to raise an eyebrow
and rejoice, because man alone beneath the sun is distinguished by
the privilege of reason. In fact, even subtle doctors say it is to be
imputed more to the form of the human body and the disposition
of the head, which is capable of accommodating reason and instruc-
tion, than to the genial vigor of a soul different in nature from the
brute souls of other animals because it possesses reason. It is possi-
ble to draw a probable and valid proof from animals in the likeness,
or (if you prefer) approaching the likeness, of man. In fact, as I have
written elsewhere, the more an animal resembles the human image,
the more it reproduces human gestures and imitates human intelli-
gence; in short, I possess an elegant and trustworthy authority for
my assertion.

[8.] But to rush forward like beasts (so to speak), if the vessel that
contains the soul, which they have all leagued together to assert is
the creator or cause of rationality, should be impaired by the power
of the supreme Deity, either by natural violence (this is, bad health)
or perhaps by the effect of an injury—if, for example, a man's head
is deformed by frenzy, a wound or any other occurrence-the man
who was previously of sound mind and discretion will immediately
fall prey to delusions. Thus it seems to be true of the human body
that the vessel which causes rationality is an instrument so uniquely
suited to its task that even if the soul which invigorates the huge
body of an elephant or ox were infused into the tiny figure of man,
it would, on account of such a noble instrument, be blessed with
and fittingly rejoice in the prerogative of rationality. In fact, a lyre
string which resonates harmoniously on a well-tuned instrument
will yield only a raucous drone on one that is ,out of tune. Thus, all
sensible people will think it a frivolous joke to develop vain notions
about the unique immortality of the human soul or spirit or to
deliver speeches on the subject.
