entering orders, after he had served as a schoolrnaster and fathered at
least one son, perhaps a family, in his earlier years.⁵⁶ Before then Elias
earned a living from his students' fees rather than his acre in Thriplow,
it is just possible that he was related to a prominent Cambridge family
surnamed le Rus or Ruffus.

3. Elias and the Antiquarians

Despite his shaky beginning, Elias entered the antiquarian
tradition with the highest possible recommendation, since Bale had
written him up in his authoritative Catalogus, ostensibly from the exhaus-
tive researches of Leland. Elias makes his next appearance in John Pits's
Relationes historicae de rebus Anglicis, where Pits explicitly assigns him the
floruit circa 1280 implied by Bale.⁵⁷ Purposing to write ecclesiastical
history favorable to the Catholic faith he espoused, Pits was eager to
undermine the Protestant Bale's authority and sought to do so by censur-
ing his pilferings from Leland. It may also be that Pits's brazen reliance
on Bale for “facts'' such as those included in his notice of Elias gave him
something of a guilty conscience in this matter. Pits's vignette of Elias as
moralizing courtier should not blind us to the fact that he relies com-
pletely on Bale for his knowledge of Elias and has no independent
authority as a witness to Elias's life and works:

Helias Rubeus was born in the town of Thriplow in Cambridgeshire,
England. After acquiring polite letters and the liberal arts in gram-
mar school, he is said to have proceeded to higher studies at Carn-
bridge, where he applied himself strenuously to first philosophy,
then theology. Leland praises him highly in his Collectanea for his
mild disposition, humanity, wisdom and range of learning. Having
long frequented the royal court, he perceptively noticed, pondered
silently by himself and discreetly wrote down that many who
sauntered about puffed up by the empty title of nobility fell short in
manner, life and in everything they did, and utterly forfeited the
esteem of which they so boasted. He warned them from time to
time, in private and with modesty, that true, innate nobility does not
derive from someone else's blood but from each person's own
worth. According to the tragedian, “He who boasts of his ancestry
praises something not his own,'' to which Ovid agrees when he

returned to the university for further studies.
