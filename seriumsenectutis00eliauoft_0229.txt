BOOK TWELVE 213

It is sufficiently arduous for an upright client

To serve one earthly master, so it is difficult

To minister to many gods in a way that pleases them all;
For poor man is always reckoned less than the godheadl

me: Elias, my companion, your powers have claimed mine for their
own, and your charges have achieved their effect in my conscience.
For 1 am almost persuaded that you have proved to anyone who
thinks sanely and sensibly that the human soul, alone among living
things, is endowed with rational foresight and remains remote by
contract from the reproach of a fatal end. With a vain plurality of
gods utterly rejected and banished from the integrity of faith, all
men should ceaselessly worship and venerate on bended knee one
supremely powerful God, and freely love and fear Him, setting
