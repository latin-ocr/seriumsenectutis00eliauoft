BOOK THREE 99

of a grove consecrated to Aesculapius and his temple to make ships
for Antony, the god mourned his loss. So after Antony's followers
were defeated in the very act of sacrilege, Aesculapius employed
the manifest powers of his godhead to drag Turullius, who was
destined to death by order of Caesar, to the grove he had violated,
and caused him to meet an appropriate death there at the hands of
Caesar' s soldiers. Thus Turullius suffered the due punishment for
cutting down the trees, and Aesculapius restored for the remaining
trees the great veneration they had always enjoyed among those
who dwelt nearby.

[26] How Jupiter avenged on Ptolemy, king of Macedonia, the
injuries he suffered as a result of the king's perjury has also been
mooted frequently. Having consolidated his rule over the Macedo-
nians by deceit and machination, and having eliminated all external
threats by inexhaustible villainy, Ptolemy, the most criminal of men,
was not afraid to turn his wicked mind to domestic crimes. He did
not blush to prepare a deadly trap for his sister Arsinoe! by which
he deprived her and her sons, whom she had borne to her deceased
husband King Lysimachus, of both their lives and the city of Cas-
sandria. Since he could not bring about the death of his sister's
sons, whose kingdom he had already seized, except by dissimulated
concord with his sister, his initial deceit was a wanton resolve to
feign a loving desire to seek his sister in marriage. But as he
guessed that his innate malice was already known to her, he an-
nounced by messenger to his sister, who scarce believed Ιὼη, that
he wished to share his realm with her sons. He claimed that he had
contended in arms with them not because he proposed to snatch the
realm from those so closely conjoined to him by blood relation, but
because he wanted them to possess it by right of his gift. He then
asked her to send someone as witness to an oath, in whose presence
he would bind himself before their ancestral gods by whatever
prayers she might wish.
