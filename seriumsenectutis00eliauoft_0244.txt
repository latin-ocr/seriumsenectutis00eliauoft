228 COMMENTARY

Elias (see 3.381-82 below). Or should we take cupido as comparative—‘'more
lustful than others¹'?

19 coniuga: Martianus 1.4 (3.9-11): “similique persuasione transduci Ope
coniuga Cybeleque permulsa maestissimum seniorem deorumst

29-53 Philip‘s objections and much of their wording are based on Martianus's
son's similar objections, De nuptiis 1.2 (2.5ff.).

34 nasove vigilanti stertendo: Juvenal, Saturae (ed. Clausen) 157: '‘doctus et ad
calicem uigilanti stertere naso''; echoed in De disciplina scolarium 6.14 (ed. Weijers,
127.6) and Petronius rediuiuus 3, 124 (ed. Colker, 196, 225).

35-36 decuriatus computacionibus: Cf. Remigius of Auxerre, Commentum in
Martianum Capellam 1.2 (ed Lutz, 70.12-14): “DECURIATUM LUSTRALIBUS
INCREMENTIS hoc est provectu aetatis simul et morum maturitate curiae honore
dignum. Lustrum enim dicebant antiqui quinquennium.''

44 epithalamicis . . . cantilenis: Cf. 6.17-18 below.

53 in vdo: Persius, Saturae (ed. Clausen) 1.105.

75 sub lodice: This phrase, which Elias uses with nearly adverbial force, comes
from Juvenal 6.195-96: “[verbis] modo sub lodice relictis s uteris in turba.'' It is
also used in the Petronius rediuiuus 47, 79, 135 (206, 214, 228).

77-80 For Cybele as the earth, see Remigius (73.12-13) in Martianum 1.4:
'‘CYBELE dicta est quasi cubele a soliditate. Ipsa est enim terra qua nihil solidius
est in elementis.''

80-84 ut sibi . .. venustet: Cf. 4.270-77 below.

82 desiccet: Cf. Plautus, Truculentus 585 (ed. Lindsay).

84-86 For the allegorical sense behind the marriage of Janus and Argiona, see
Remigius (73.17-20) in Martianum 1.4: “IANUS deus anni. IANUS dictus est quod
ianuam pandit anni. Hinc et mensis Ianuarius bifrons depingitur propter ingres-
sum et egressum anni, a nonnullis quadrifrons propter quattuor anni tempora vel
propter quattuor caeli climata.''

89-93 Admeto . .. animositatem: The general sense of this sentence is clear
enough, although the syntax could be simplified by emending aliquid (91) to
aliquis, agreeing with sensatus (91). Otherwise, construe vix aliquid humanitatis
accedere negaret ad vtilitatem as meaning “will deny that [the marriage of Alcestis
to Admetus] is of practically no use to humanity''; that is, it is of considerable
utility. Fulgentius's account of how Admetus won the hand of Alcestis, Mitologiae,
chap. 22 (ed. Helm, 33.20ff.), is repeated more or less verbatim by all three
Vatican Mythographers (ed. Kulcsar, 39, 236,- ed. Bode, 1.31.14-26, 128.33-129.1o,
and 247.26-248.6). Elias's mention of healthy ardor or courage (salubrem . . .
animositatem) echoes the Third Mythographer's allegorical exposition of this
marriage (ed. Bode, 1.247.38ff.). According to all four accounts, Admetus repre-
sents the mind and Alcestis the truculence (petulancia) which the mind must
acquire to overcome its fear and function successfully. Elias parallels the mar-
riages of Mercury and Philology, Admetus and Alcestis, because of the similarity
of their allegorical significances rather than any literal similarity of circumstance.
Phicii and Tirincii render Pythius and Tirynthius, common epithets of Apollo and
Hercules. Ovid is particularly fond of the latter.

loo-104 The notion that wisdom should be conjoined with eloquence finds its
first definitive expression in Cicero's portrait of the ideal orator, De inventione 1.1-
5 (ed. Stroebel, 1-6). Cicero later treats ratio and oratio as the essentia! bonds of
human society at De officiis 1.50 (ed. Atzert, 18.7-16). The theme is also made
available to the Middle Ages by Quintilian, Marius Victorinus, Augustine of
Hippo, and Cassiodorus (Nuchelmans, “Philologia et son mariage,'' 85-89).
