RECONSTRUCTING A LIFE 5

survey of lands belonging to the bishop in 12225 among those holding
land in Thriplow it names “Helyas le mastre'' as the farmer of one cot-
land (fol. 220v). This small holding, probably one acre in extent,²¹ would
not have sufficed to feed an individual, let alone a family.²² It was,
moreover, burdened with the heavy obligation of furnishing the bishop
two days' work per week. As a result, it would not have served as a
benefice rewarding Elias for service to the bishop or See of Ely and must,
instead, be considered a family holding, although it is unlikely that Elias
would have farmed it himself.

Elias would either have been leasing the land to an undertenant or
if resident and running the farm himself (which is very unlikely
given his other interests) would presumably not have stooped to
labour in the fields himself.. . . Elias held his cotland exactly as they
did, but only in that he was responsible for seeing that the services
were performed.²³

Thus, one major piece of evidence for Elias's authorship of the Petronius
rediuiuus is the author's claim, at the end of that work: “it is from farmers

that 1 took my birth.''²⁴¹
We have seen that Bale placed Elias among a group of writers who

died about 1280 '‘until he finds his proper place.'' In fact, that place must

Maitland, Township and Borough (Cambridgez Cambridge Univ. Press, 1898). The rectory of
Thriplow was later granted by Bishop Hugh of Balsham to the scholars of what became
Peterhouse, first to be shared (1280) with the Hospita! of St. John, where the scholars were
located, then for the sole use of the scholars when they relocated to two hostels outside the
Trumpington Gate in 1284; see H. Butterfield, “Peterhouse,'' in The Victoria County History
