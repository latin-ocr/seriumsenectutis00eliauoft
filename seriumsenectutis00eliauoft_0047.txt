GENRE 31

unique omnipotence, but he clearly showcases arguments derived from
Aristotle's Physics and Metaphysics, the so·called libri naturales, which
came into general circulation in Europe in the first half of the thirteenth
century. In Elias's choice of a source in the new Aristotle, rather than the
old logic which Boethius had done so much to transmit, we see the
literary and philosophie spirit of the Roman alive in the Englishman.
Here, surely, we find startling confirmation of T. S. Eliot's claim that “not
only the best, but the most individual parts of [a poet's] work may be
those in which the dead poets, his ancestors, assert their immortality
most vigorously.''¹⁰⁴

What about Eliot's related claim that, “The existing order [of literature]
is complete before the new work arrives; for order to persist after the
supervention of novelty, the whole existing order must be, if ever so
slightly, altered; and so the relations, prosportions, values of each work of
art toward the whole are readjusted''?¹⁰ Having read Elias, we see that
Martianus Capella was still, in the thirteenth century, a rallying point for
those seeking a marriage between technical knowledge and literary style
as defined by the grammatical tradition.¹⁰⁶ We see Boethius valued
primarily for the telos of his Consolation, not the early books which we
tend to favor. We also see Boethius and Martianus as representatives of
antiquity (venerata vetustas, to use Elias's term) valued above the Menip—
pean satirists of the twelfth century. But this Martianus, so far from being
a practicing theurgist, as modern scholars have argued,¹⁰⁷ is a pre-
sumptive Christian with an antiquarian interest in the pagan past (4.401-
3). Nor can one easily imagine Elias espousing an ironic account of a
benighted narrator and deficient Philosophy in Boethius. Both Elias and
Philip make light of the former's advanced age (an aspect of the carnival-
ization Bakhtin writes of), but there is every reason to believe that Elias
was in fact an old man when he wrote the Serium senectutis. Elias would
have ridiculed any attempt to discover an ironic disparity between
author and narrator in his own work or in Boethius's. We may even see
Elias's frequent echoes of Horace, Persius, and Juvenal as an attempt to
heal the breach between Menippean satire and moralizing verse satire in
Latin—to see a community of purpose and values between what seem to
us antithetical traditions.¹⁰⁸
