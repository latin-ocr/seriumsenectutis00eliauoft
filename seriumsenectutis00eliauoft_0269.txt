ELIAS AND THE PETRONIUS REDIUIUUS 253

Γέῗοῦὲεᾶυξξῐέξνεῃ more than the wording, here is extremely close to Satyrica 33-

sicut ficti adulatores cum cenas divitum captant nihil prius meditantur
quam id quod putant gratissimum auditoribus fore (nec enim aliter impetra-
bunt quod petunt nisi quasdam insidias auribus fecerint), sic eloquentiae
magister, nisi tamquam piscator eam imposuerit hamis escam, quam scierit
appetituros esse pisciculos, sine spe praedae moratur in scopulo.²²

'I'here are no knockdown arguments here for Elias‘s authorship of the Petronius
rediuiuus. But the cumulative weight of the evidence is considerable. If Elias did
not write the Petronius rediuiuus, then whoever did must almost certainly have
been known to our author. If Elias did write the Petronius rediuiuus, how does this
new attribution alter our sense of the author and his other works? Perhaps most
strikingly, the legal material, especially the material derived from civil law, in the
Petronius rediuiuus brings into sharper focus the legal material in the Serium
senectutis and De vita scolarium. And l think it makes the possibility that Elias had
undertaken at least some formal legal studies something closer to a probability.
Certainly, authorship of the Petronius rediuiuus would cause Elias's oeuvre to
loom larger in bulk and importance, and that work's knowledge and use of
Petronius would reinforce the sense we should already have from the Serium
senectutis and the fragmentary works that Elias was widely read in classical
literature and history. Finally, the obscene passages in the Petronius rediuiuus
would give the presumably elderly author of the Serium senectutis a youth and
frivolity which should increase his appeal to modern readers, even if the antifem-
inism of the Petronius rediuiuus and De vita scolarium tends in another direction.

Appendix 3. Corrections to the Manuscript
not Recorded in the Textual Apparatus

The first group of corrections not recorded in the apparatus comprises
Texerii¹s additions, deletions, and corrections while copying the text. He custom-
arily marks with a pair of slashes (ll) where additions are to be placed. He also
uses the slashes to indicate deletions, although he more commonly expunctuates
letters and underlines words to be deleted. Corrections are by expunctuation and
superscription or by overwriting. All these corrections were made with the pen
Texerii used to copy the surrounding text. 1.111 del. -ve before nec, 232 ad.
