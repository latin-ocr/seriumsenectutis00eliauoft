232 COMMENTARY

that another est has fallen out of the phrase magnaque subsequenter vi tempestatis
oppressus (143-44).

144-45 Iouisque . . . inmanitatem: Elias adds to Justinus here, transfor-ming a
story of the Fall of Princes variety into a tale of divine vengeance, as befits
Philip's argument in this passage. The two causes of Alexander‘s downfall
embody in miniature Elias's two basic styles: a relatively straightforward narra-
tive style (magna . . . vi tempestatis [143-441) and a convoluted style for comment
or reflection (Iouisque . . . inmanitatem).

148 ingratus [est]: sc. hominibus [et] numinibus (150-51).

149 compendiario: ‘'sc. iter'' (OLD). Cf. Seneca, Epistulae morales 73.12 (ed.
ReynoldS, 1.223.13).

152-80 Justinus 1.9.1ff. (12.24ff.).

152-55 Cambisis . . . ulcionem: Construe: Memorat vetustatis auctoritas . . . ulcionem
diuinitatis mote per iniurias criminis Cambisis cachynnabilis commisi in iniuriam
Hamonis. For the objective genitive of the person upon whom vengeance is taken
with ultio, see note to 2.89-90 above.

164-67 For an analysis of this passage, see above, 39.

169-70 Nempe . . . vidisset: Justinus 1.9.4-5 (12.29-13.1) makes it clear that this
was a dream.

170-72 hec . . . procurante: Again Elias, or his speaker Philip, adds divine
causation to Justinus's strictly historical account, as also at 176 below.

171 facillitas: While CL facilitas, “indulgence; excessive clemency,'' would make
sense here, the doubling of the ll, the similar phrase facillantis ingenii (4.455), and
Texerii's ffv confusion elsewhere suggest that we should take facillitas as equiva-
lent to vacillitas (from vacillo) or “wavering inconstancy.‘'

172-73 vehementer . . . non formidauit: Itis possible that vehementissime is intend-
ed as a correction for vehementer, but given Texerii's care elsewhere to underline
deleted words, we may conclude that Elias intended a chiastic arrangement of
adverbs' and verbs in this line.

176 paricidas . . . manus: Paricidas is better taken as an adjective than a noun in ap-
position. Although the form is unattested, corruption from paricidales is unlikely.

187-88 The MS reading confortunalium, while unattested, may stand. Its sense
would be “sharing the same fortune or prosperity.‘' But emending to consortium
might yield better sense in the context of Cambyses's parricide.

188 genialiterque consimilium: Perhaps Elias means “those related by marriage,''
but “products of the same marriage bed'' seems more likely in context. For
Genius, see below 1056 and note.

191-275 Justinus 2.10.2ff. (30.9ff.).

198 naues . . . numero: The consensus of MS classes used by Seel in his edition
of Justinus reads “naues quoque decies centum milium dicitur,'' which yields no
acceptable sense. In his second edition, Seel adopts Ruehl's emendation, based on
the account given by Orosius, Historiae aduersum paganos 2.9.2 (ed. Zangemeister,
45.29-30): “naues quoque rostratas mille ducentas, onerarias autem tria milia
numero habuisse dicitur.'' His details indicate that Elias follows Justinus rather
than the more summary account of Orosius here, but Elias seems to have used a
MS of Justinus which at this point preserved a notice of the three thousand cargo
ships mentioned by Orosius but already missing from the MSS used by Seel.

208 connexa: con uexa (¹‘concavities''), the reading in Justinus, would yield better
sense. But Seel does record the reading connexa from his D ( ⁸ Vat. lat. 1860; s.
xiv.).

216 angustias: The pass is, of course, Thermopyla& Justinus 2.11.2 (31.15-16).
