BOOK THREE 89

ed in the pass at Thermopylae, King Xerxes, out of contempt for the
Greeks' scarcity, ordered into battle those of his soldiers whose
kinsmen had died at Marathon. ΤῙιεγ prepared in haste to avenge

men, who were fully prepared to die, to do anything he asked.
Laudably deciding that they owed more to their country than their
own lives, they set aside all deliberation and stood manfully to

camp of 500,000 soldiers. Before they went into battle, the king had
