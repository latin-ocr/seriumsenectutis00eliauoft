[5.] To take our beginning for healthy and wounded alike from
Ambrose's discourse, Ambrose elegantly writes: “So that God, who
was and is invisible by nature might be recognized and known
from what is visible, He created a work which by its visibility
demonstrates its artificem thus an idea of what is uncertain can
suitably be achieved through what is certain. Consequently, He who
created such a work, which would be impossible for any created
thing to effect, should be believed in as the God of all things.'' So
this man of flourishing sense inferred from contemplating the great
and unique fabric of the universe that it could by no means have
been created by any created thing, and he understood to good effect
that the artificer of such a beautiful image or work must be much
more powerful than man. By this line of reasoning he assured
himself of the knowledge of God; thus, the invisible things of God
are known by creatures through those things which are created.

[6.] Men preeminent for their genuine subtlety and praiseworthy
for their subtle knowledge of what is right have advanced many
other arguments which are confirmed in faith by the subtle and
solid arguments of such men and perpetually established as funda-
mentally solid without crack or ruin. To begin with the assertions of
Aristotle, authentic and unmixed with falsehood, this man of singu·
lar subtlety comprehended all things under the sun with the utmost
brevity, thus: '‘Whatever exists under the sun is either accident or
substance; or, to exclude any unfounded objection, substance is
prior to accident, if you care to distinguish.'' ¹¹Accident'' is to be
taken here more broadly than it normally is in logic, namely as all
that is incapable of separate existence. Indeed substance, which
underlies accidents or accidentals, took its name from underlying or
subsisting. We should, with prompt mind or thought, conceive of
something which exists separately and of itself, that is, by the
agency of no other, which is that through which and from which all
things exist. That which a sensible man supplicates is clearly to be
reckoned God, and it must be (or at least have been) unique be-
cause of the discord of a permanent regress. For if it were preceded
by another from which it came, and so on, it would be impossible
